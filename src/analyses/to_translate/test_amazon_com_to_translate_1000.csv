1,"Cheap Junk from China.. Do better Amazon too hard to pull out.  Had for less than a month before the cord broke because its so hard to pull out.  I threw this trash in the garbage in frustration.  I should have listened to the other reviews stating this problem."
4,"Great starter bag! THANKS AMAZON BASICS!!! This is a great camera bag for the beginning to intermediate photographer for the price, features &amp; durability. The bright orange interior makes it easy to find camera equipment &amp; accessories. My only suggestions would be to reconfigure the strap setup.. they are really long, and the belt isn’t necessarily something you need to use on a daily basis, and would be better served as an option (like the interior colors are) or a removable accessory. I would also recommend a different zipper/fastening system because these zippers tend to come undone on their own if they’re left at the top of the bag if the bag is full and the internal weight distribution isn’t very balanced while you just walk around. I love how much this bag can hold, and for the price, it’s a no-brainer. You will look at every camera bag differently after owning one of these and using it every day."
4,"Third bottles the charm! This is the third bottle i purchased for my third child. We tried the playtex and mam bottles and she just hated the nipples. The tommee tippee nipple she took to right away. We sometimes have an issue with the vent, but a squeeze before i put it on the bottle works. I do recommend if you breast and bottle feed my lo never had an issue taking the bottle vs breast."
4,"Keeps coffee warm I like using a normal coffee cup rather than an insulated travel mug whenever possible, but the downside of a mug on my desk at work is that the coffee is cold by the time I get to the last couple sips. The Mr. Coffee Mug Warmer does a great job of keeping those last couple sips of coffee warm. Don't expect it to keep it hot (or at least as hot as I'd like it, somewhere close to the 190f brewing temp), but it will keep it from getting to room temp.  The one issue I have with it is that it only has an on/off switch rather than a timer or a weight-based switch. It's a little concerning, because at least once I left it on at work over a long weekend. Nothing came of it, so it wasn't that big of a deal, but after that I made sure to train myself to shut it off immediately following my last sip of coffee.  That aside, I'm pretty happy with my purchase and would recommend it to anyone that wants to keep their coffee warm."
5,"Very Impressed The quality and overall size of this are amazing.  Delicate but still a solid statement piece.  The pin clasp seems very sturdy.  Overall, incredibly pleased with this purchase."
5,"Incredible value For the price these headphones are a terrific value! The sounds quality is higher than my Jabra 65t and it has some nice touches that I have not seen in other wireless earbuds.  The obvious one is the case. This case is made of metal which just looks nicer than the plastic cases most other earbuds come in. The earbuds also ""snap"" into the case with magnets which also just feels nice. The most unique thing about this case is the LCD screen that shows how much charge the case has. This is incredibly handy! Most of my other earbuds use a red, yellow, green indicator to give the status of the battery. I find a number between 1 and 100 to be more useful.  Lets talk about sound quality. I am far from an audiophile and mostly listen to podcasts or audio books, but these sound terrific (especially since they only cost $40)! The only ding against this product is that they sometime go out of sync with each other for a second at a time so one ear may go a little quite for a half second before coming back to normal. I've had that with all wireless ear buds so this does not bother me at all.  They fit in my ear just fine. They feel a little loose but they don't fly out of my head when I shake it violently so I would say it is tight enough for me.  Overall, for $40 this is a great deal. I would buy these over my Jabra ear buds any day."
5,"My favorite soccer sock Favorite soccer sock ever, been playing for years. Not too tight on calf, but doesn’t fall down. Love the extra ring around the arch for extra support, have bought several pair"
5,"Has lasted The lid didn’t fit snugly and off center when first received but eventually evened out. I’ve used this in my high volume restaurant bathroom for almost a year now with zero issues. Foot pedal is holding just fine, no complaints. If only I could teach my customers to put their wet paper towels in it 100% of the time."
5,"Large, durable backpack with lots of room for packing extras. Bought this for my husband to take the place of his briefcase. He LOVES it! Takes it to work everyday and on trips. Fits under the seat in airplanes. Several different pockets and storage areas. Comfortable to wear with nicely padded shoulder straps. Has retained its durability over this past year...better than any briefcase he has ever owned."
5,"Classic watch that anyone could wear! I bought this for my 84 year old father after he said he’d like to have a watch. When we opened it and gave it to him, he was so happy and said this is exactly what I wanted! He loves the easy to read numbers and the stretchy band. He was like a kid at Christmas when he discovered there was a backlight on it! The fact that he doesn’t have to ask what time or date it is gave him a certain sense of independence! Take you Timex for creating the perfect watch for my dad! Thank you amazon for offering it."
5,"I totally love this product This product came fast and I really love it I will buy more"
5,"Nice Nice and large. Not too heavy. Color does not fade, so after a few months they still look brand new."
5,"none like it"
5,"she loves it my daughter loves her back pack uses it for more then just her dance class"
5,"Amazing Absolutely love!"
5,"Really Great activity We bought this for a friends child and he absolutely loves it.  Do not hesitate. Buy it! Educational and fun all at the same time."
5,"Worth the money! I wish we had gotten this years ago, because that's how long it looks like it will last.  I purchased this for my high-school senior, and she couldn't be happier with the quality.  I spend the same amount of money for a 'fashion' (colorful) backpack at a high-end retailer online, and I have no doubt that this backpack will hold up, while the other won't last half of the school year."
2,"Broke in 5 months not under warranty My son loves this watch, it would get a 5 star except it broke after 5 months. The pin on the band that holds the band together broke in half while he was wearing it.  When I called customer service they said the warranty only covers the inside workings of the watch. A pin that breaks in 5 months is defective. I should not have to pay them to fix it!"
3,"Not very satisfied Worked well for 2 weeks. Then I had to contact support and exchange.  There was an electrical short and touch pad would not work."
1,"Bad product.... I bought this watch a year ago and was using this at Sanfrancisco.  I worked well and I didn't know it has a problem.  And recently I moved to Boston and tried to change the time mode and realized that crown is bad!  As you can see in the picture crown gets separated from the watch so I cannot operate this watch. I didn't realize  that in SF since I didn't need to operate since it is atomic time keeping...  Well, I lost the warranty card (of course there is a record in this site that I bought this), and it is a year ago that I bought this.. so I wonder if I can do something?? (In current situation this watch can be only used in West side of the US)"
1,"Avoid Arrived damaged.  Quality is dreadful.  There are only two types of tabs.  Only reason I am keeping is because of timing and the hidden costs to return : time, gas"
1,"This watch runs about 15 minutes behind each 24 hours ... This watch runs about 15 minutes behind each 24 hours.  This watch shall be within one year warranty. Where can it be fixed by warranty?"
4,"Would defiantly purchase again and great for someone wanting to learn to read and eventually ... Bought this tape measure for my girlfriend who starting welding recently, one day she didnt have her welding supervisor and was able to read the prints and weld a piece with this tape. She said she would get another after it wears out! Would defiantly purchase again and great for someone wanting to learn to read and eventually not need the designated marks"
4,"Very comfortable and convenient bag I first saw this bag in REI they had other fun colors and funky patterns. Bag is lightweight w a super soft strap. Two small net pockets in the big zipper with a bigger pocket along the back lining"
4,"It's HP ink. It's ink. It's HP ink.  Works in the correct HP printer. Color is black. Shipped as expected."
5,"Love it Great product"
5,"I bought two watches and even though I like the simple look of the other one (can see ... <div id=""video-block-R2KTV9JCXPU6QM"" class=""a-section a-spacing-small a-spacing-top-mini video-block""></div><input type=""hidden"" name="""" value=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91iBj7N-0xS.mp4"" class=""video-url""><input type=""hidden"" name="""" value=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91ATdHH2oeS.png"" class=""video-slate-img-url"">&nbsp;I bought two watches and even though I like the simple look of the other one (can see both in attached video) this one seems to be a better build quality and where little things like the seconds arm not covering each stripe precisely (will see in video) bothers me a lot with the other one. This one does not have any of those problems. In my opinion it is a great buy whilst it is still on special."
5,"Compact yet functional This is compact and has good speed. I am tired of purchasing 10 pc blenders, this is perfect and price is okay."
5,"Glad I bought it Just received this watch in the mail today, so I reserve the right to revisit this 5-star review.  For present purposes, I just wanted to provide my initial thoughts while they're still fresh in my mind.  When I opened the box (original, with papers), I was initially disappointed upon seeing what appeared to be the days of the week written in Arabic.  Nevertheless, I decided I liked the watch otherwise and was going to give it a shot (and replace the strap, which I purchased separately).  So glad I did.  After spending about a minute reading the manual, I figured out that this Japanese version of the 009 is ""bi-lingual.""  It can display either Arabic (I think) or English.  Needless to say, I opted for the English, and my satisfaction level grew exponentially.  As far as its looks and feel, it is about what I expected.  I'm a male with a medium sized wrist (probably 6.5 inches or so) and this watch fits just right.  If you're a guy who likes a big watch, this one is not for you and it might seem disappointingly small.  It wears and looks like a 40mm watch, for what it's worth.  The fit and finish appear to be in good order so far.  Upon first glance, the stainless steel almost had the look of chrome (shiny), but I warmed up to it quickly.  The uni-directional bezel moves precisely (120 clicks per revolution, which is nice).  My one minor complaint is that the knurl of the bezel seemed a bit slippery; not especially so, but that was my first impression anyway.  The last thing I wanted to mention is that, before I even tried it on, I took off the stock rubber (silicon?) band.  It's not my taste at all, but I suppose someone who is using this watch for serious diving might think differently.  Instead, I replaced it immediately with a navy-red 22mm NATO strap (for about $14 on Amazon), which looks terrific on this watch -- I initially worried that the navy would be too bright compared to the midnight blue face.  Altogether, this feels like a very solid watch that seems like a good buy in the $200-250 range.  So far, it appears to be keeping excellent time (but it's only been several hours since I've had it) and I've had no issues with the crown, etc.  For what it's worth, I'll mention that others have said this (Japanese) version is superior to the Chinese version -- and costs a bit more too.  I can't say whether this premium is warranted, but I thought I'd repeat it in case this might be something that is important to you (one way or the other).  As I said before, if my initial impressions change, I'll be glad to update my review."
5,"It fits my HP Pavilion dv7 laptop! I have been struggling trying to find a rolling backpack to fit my monster laptop.  The laptop was a gift, and I love it, but it is a beast, measuring 12 x 17.5 inches.  It's a snug fit, but it fits! Plus I have room for 4 textbooks, a couple notebooks, my TI-84 calculator, laptop charger, pencils, and wiggle room. Also the side compartment for a water bottle on the side is a bonus.  Truly, this has been a dream for me.  The color is perfect(Cuban Brown), rolls smoothly, and so far no problems.  There are pockets in the outermost compartment that are for pens/pencils, so the reviewer that said there was no room for such must have gotten a different model. I would highly recommend this for those that have large laptops.  I haven't had a problem so far...it's been a month and I lug this around daily..and even nightly to the library for studying."
5,"Buy now! Great purchase! I’m so happy with the earrings. Cute, simple, lightweight, versatile, and a great value. All the colors/metals you need!"
5,"These are stunning and beautifulPerfect earrings These are stunning and beautiful"
5,"Beautiful new jacket for my cat to climb on! I love this jacket.  I practically live in these and have three which I alternate but are beginning to show the wear.  My cat climbs all over my shoulders and the fleece blunts the claw impact--so, yes, eventual wear--in any case,  I thought I would spring for a new one.  I wasn't sure I would like the color. Forward is the color name.  It looked rather greyish in the photo, but in person it's a smoky blue with some purple mixed in.  In the sun, the color comes off looking somewhat lighter.  I think it's beautiful."
5,"Very nice I love it nice product"
5,"The item was great just not the right color This item returned label is in the bag with the return label #DHYD9znsRRMA. Both items were in the same package. When this item is view I will be expecting a return to my account. Thanks Patricia Davis"
5,"Five Stars Excelent"
5,"My favorite calculator I use this calculator every day.  Everything works, the big numbers are sharp and easy to read, the keys are comfortable, it's stable on my desk, and it's a good size.  It has auto-shutoff after 6 minutes, but I use the Off button to prolong battery life. Though it's a reliable 5 star calculator, the user manual could be easier to read (larger) and explain the key functions better."
5,"Love this outfit I’m 5’2”, 240lbs and I ordered a 3x because I didn’t want it to be too fitting and judging from another reviewer, it fits perfect! Love it and will be ordering more in all colors. Might try a 2x next time just so I can have one that hugs me."
2,"Not recognized by printer The printer will not recognize this cartridge.  Went through all of the trouble shooting.  Nothing works.  A waste of $75.00.  I added a star to the review.  We were able to use the toner cartridge after calling the customer support telephone number on brother's webpage after exhausting all online trouble shooting.  This took several days to resolve which is something I don't expect when buying genuine brother toner for a brother printer."
3,"Runs large, long arms, but quality is just as described My 5’2 ft sister, 115 lbs, 26 waist likes it because it’s qualities are exactly as described but unfortunately it runs large for me which is why I am only giving it a 3 star. I am a 5’0 ft woman, 90 lbs, 32C bust, 23 waist, 26 hips so even the xs ran large for me with weirdly long arms. If your measurements are similar to mine, consider buying children sizes."
3,"The Up and The Down Sides of This Watch ! The benefited from this watch is it collects energy from the Sun or any lights to run its mechanism. The draw-back is you have to wear and let its face out of your sleeves,otherwise you have to place it under the bright light or at least do not put in under your drawer when you're not wearing it or it'll die later. The other down side of the watch unlike other standard watches in setting times. It is very confused for adjusting its analog/digital(set time)that you will always to have your manual booklet whenever you need to adjust its time. Another big blow back is the watch is not precised on keeping time and its always 2-3 minutes runs faster within two-three weeks."
1,"Hot flashes brought on! This does not work save your hard earned money.. Brings on Hot flashes....I discontinued these not happy"
1,"Used once! Purchased in October of 18, used once worked well.....tried to use it March 19 doesn't work. I did call customer service and they were very nice and helpful and will send a replacement when they receive this one.....which is good but in the mean time I have to go and purchase another one because I need one today.........Will not purchase this specific one again!!!"
4,"so good we bought another one... I bought this for me and the wife to use washing our baby's bottles and my wife's breast pump and supplies.  It's built well - very sturdy - and has held up really well.  The bristles are very soft and mold to reach all the nooks and crannies of the bottles.  The tip of the other end can get up into the ends of the nipples to clean them out as well.  Is it wrong that I feel funny using the word nipple in a review?  :-)  Anyway, the brush works so well my wife asked me to buy another one for her to take to work.  She uses it there to clean the breast pump machine and supplies when she pumps at the office.  We're happy with the performance so far - if anything changes I will make an update..."
4,"HIgh Power, Low Price I replaced a $1200 Thermador cooktop with a $389 Fridgidare and so far I'm happy that I did.  Installation was more difficult that I expected; they didn't bother to install brackets for my previous unit, so I had to install brackets on my granite. I didn't like the suggested method (silicone only) so it added a day to the process to do it more securely. I also had to cut a hole in the wall because the genius installers left the box exposed for the wiring, but there was no way to get to the clamp. Patching that is another project in my future.  The reason I like this unit was 1) It was crazy cheap 2) It had a low powered and high powered element in the front, which fits my cooking style. ""Quick Boil"" is 3000 watts; I do my boiling in an instant pot, but the extra power is useful when stir frying or searing steaks. Even the smaller inside element is 1600 watts. My previous cooktop had 2 1200 in the front and a 2500 and 2000 watt in the rear. You can't stir fry on the rear element easily.  I feel like this unit is a bit more ""glassy"" than my previous unit; a bit more fragile. Time will tell how it holds up.  A downside is that I have to re-learn how to cook my favorite dishes, as the settings and power is very different. The Quick Boil element will burn fried potatoes on 3 in a couple of minutes. On the bright side is that the wok heats up in half the time."
5,"Cute Every nice fabric. Fit was perfect"
5,"Great little backpack I took this bag to Iceland. It worked out great. There are so many pockets and zipper compartments which allowed me plenty of storage space."
5,"They are very beautiful Came package in a box with a pouch included.  Just beautiful."
5,"Very Hot Pants!! Beautiful!! Fantastic fit and I feel so sexy!! I can't wait to buy more from the series!!  Toni"
5,"It’s a gift 🎁 This is a gift. Didn’t try it on. Looks great. Hope it fits the person it is gifted to."
5,"Great for days you work out A bit pricier but I can work out with confidence now.  Only use these the days I work out and the regular poise the days I do not."
5,"Looking for Versatile? Durable? Masculine? Fine quality ? This has a laptop segment. Two water bottle sides. A charging and headphones segment. This is perfect for engineering students. Its black so dirty does not show as much as other colors. The straps are comfortable and well adjustable. The book space is decent but let's be real who carries books? It's common to carry folders binders etc and it is more than enough to handle a full time college student engineering who likes to look sharp yet pay once and graduate. This lasts Its fine quality for the price it's not no Versace or Louie leather but it is premium material for price. Good bang for buck.  And it's not feminine. It's sharp and makes you look alpha. Well recommend"
5,"Possibly, the coolest backpack on the market! This backpack is really awesome ! Looks very business oriented, and feels like it's made from good quality materials!  This backpack doesnt have a lot of room but I was still able to cram everything from my old backpack into it making it look completely more organized. It's perfect for traveling light! And keeping the look minimalistic. The detachable key ring and card slot are very useful ! Only flaw I have encountered is the straps are made from the nylon so it tends to scratch my neck area but loosing the straps solves that issue. Overall this is a great investment !"
5,"Great coffee I like a really strong coffee that is not bitter. The Nespresso Intensio is perfect. When I am away from home, I never have a cup as satisfying as my Nespresso Instensio!"
5,"Excellent laptop backpack I have a SwissGear wheel bag but needed something I could use when snow is on the ground that wouldn't get my back out of whack. After looking at a number of bags and reading reviews, I chose this one.  This bag has more than enough room and compartments to intelligently organize my ""stuff."" Note that it would be easy to overload this bag, it has so much capacity! But all the gear that was too heavy to carry in a standard laptop case became much easier to carry in this pack. The bag is comfortable on my back; padding in both the shoulder straps and backside of the pack really provide comfort. There is a stiff fold-down flap at the bottom of one of the compartments that creates a flat surface so the bag doesn't tip over when placed on the ground. I finally have a convenient way to carry a good-sized water bottle and umbrella. I really like that is has two handles--one a bit more robust than the other--for more balanced grabbing. Construction seems very solid.  After just a few days I was so confident using this bag that I took it as a carry-on for a trip out of the country. It fit fine under the aircraft seat and has worked well for both gear transport and a convenient way to carry goodies during day trips.  As long it the bag holds up under normal use, I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a convenient, comfortable way to carry and access your laptop and associated gear."
5,"2yrs strong and still my favorite Ordered this bag over 2 years ago so the review is long overdue due to the fact this bag still looks brand new and is used in a variety of settings. I often use it for work and get a ton of compliments which led to several coworkers also purchasing the bag. I’ve used it for outings with my Elementary age boys at the zoo, camping, museums, and most importantly theme Parks! The storage is amazing and the style is an added bonus. The fabric/material is durable and it’s comfortable to wear all day. I’m tempted to order another bag in a different color because it’s my go to backpack for all day events. So far 7 friends have ordered this bag when they saw me using it. They also love it. Highly recommend it."
5,"Really helped with gas These bottles really help with taking in less air for my babies - my twins used to struggle with gas a lot with previous bottles we were using and after switching to these we noticed a huge improvement.  Just make sure you keep the small disk-like piece for if you are traveling with the bottles, I learned the hard way if you don't use that piece and then your bottle tips over in your cooler, it will leak everywhere, even with the lid on!"
5,"Good buy Good starter backpack. I replaced it with a different brand. But I kept this one as a backup. Good buy for the money."
2,"Bad Connection These headphones are overall great, the only problem is the connection. Every time I play my music, it will automatically disconnect randomly and start playing on my speaker, after a few seconds it connects back and plays extremely loudly on my headphones then goes static. I’ve forgot it from my iphone xr multiple times and I still have the same problem. Looking at the reviews, nobody seemed to have this problem, I would be satisfied if I had a working pair."
3,"good for the price Good motor. It is loud but it does the job. I use it for simple smoothies and ice crushing. I don't like the lid. It's the only part that feels cheap. It's unnecessarily hard to clean too."
1,"Not like the pic shows at all this is a horrible pic of stuff you don't even get in the pic shows 6 of Soho Coco main reason I ordered it to try the cherry but no Soho flavors in the box at all. Then I get 3 charleston chew flavors which pic shows one and then the most I get is peanut butter the one I can't drink. Well, I can say I will never order again this product or anything from Two Rivers. Amazon your quality of service has been going downhill that makes 3 orders in a week times you messed up one I never get you tell me sorry it was returned some kind of damage one I get a day late and then this not being the product I wanted basically."
1,"Not for taking phone calls in loud environments Listening to music is great, and the noise cancelling is awesome. However, should you want to make a phone call, the microphone is of such terrible quality as to be mostly unusable. If you ever try to take a phone call in a crowded place such as an airport, the other party will be completely unable to hear you. When using these to place a phone call, it is worse than a cheap $10 Chinese headset. Works great other than talking on the phone, but I would've expected better from Bose."
4,"Color is a little off I like the over all look of this bag and the function of it. It's perfect for holding just enough but the front flap is a little awkward since it's stiff when I fold it over the bag to get into it the whole bag almost flips. I'm sure I just need to break it in but that my only complaint. I got this in magenta and the picture it a bit deceiving... the actual purse is much lighter in color and not as burgundy as I thought it would be. But I like the color much better in person."
4,"Good Anti-Theft Bag The anti-theft aspects of the bag gave me a lot of peace of mind.  Used it during 16 days in many of the crowded tourist traps of Europe and had zero issues with theft, etc.  However, did wish the bag had one or two more zippered areas inside the bag, especially one that could more easily fit a couple of passports.  The built in “rain suit” in its own zippered compartment on the bottom of the bag came in handy and worked great for the couple of days the weather turned bad."
4,"Different styles, order a different size Pay attention to which style you’re ordering because the sizing is different! I’m 5’4” 125lb and originally ordered the style that ties at the ankles and is flat at the front of the waist in my regular size S. This was super cute and fit perfectly! LOVE. Especially for the “baggier” style that’s shown on the model. I loved it so much I decided to order in a different color, but ordered the style without the ankle bows that has more elastic at the waist.. did not fit as shown. Surprisingly it was not the waist that was too tight but in the butt and thighs. I have very small/thin butt and and thighs, but less of a defined waist so I can’t imagine how tight this would be on someone of my size but a curvier figure. To be clear it fit, but was not the intended style as shown. If you’re ordering the style that ties at the ankle order your regular size; for the plain ankles size up!"
5,"It is a great microwave for a compact size Bought this microwave to replace an older model that died.  It is a great microwave for a compact size, but I can't help feeling ripped off paying such a high price for it.  If I had the space, I could have a bigger microwave for less money.  For a compact microwave, it has all of the features we use as I don't do much with it, except defrost frozen items, warm up veggies/soup, and sometimes pop popcorn.  I might use more features if I had them, but I am extremely limited to a specific size oven.  It cooks well and quickly; the sensor settings seem to be accurate.  There is an interior light when you open the door and while cooking.  The control panel is difficult to see if you don't have decent lighting where the oven sits.  I have noticed it is much quieter than the previous one.  In fact, you can hardly hear it when it's running.  I am not a fan of the stainless steel, as I am constantly having to wipe off fingerprints, but the bisque finish I had is no longer available.  Overall, this is a great little over; just over priced when compared to larger ovens with more features."
5,"Love these Flavors My family recently bought two Nespresso machines, one for a son at college, and it's so much better than I imagined. We're just starting to experiment with the flavors, but this package is AMAZING, frothy, rich, and worth the money."
5,"Great place holder, Has not turned black I bought this ring back in June 2018 because I had gained weight and my real rings stopped fitting. Very satisfied with this purchase and wanted to wait so I can write an honest and accurate review. The size I ordered fits just right and despite constantly washing my hands throughout the day it has not turned black and all the stones are still in place! I don't shower with it but do put lotion on daily and still no complaints. Overall very happy with this ring and it's a great place holder until I can wear my real rings again!"
5,"Convenient, and amazing quality! I used to own a Jaybird sports Bluetooth earphone, but it broke last month, and I really wanted a sports earphone. I am glad I got this as for the price, the quality is amazing! Though the battery life tends to run out quickly but the quality definitely amazed me. Also, the noise cancelation is great as well!"
5,"simple to use I hate complicated watches that require the manual to use. I want to know what time it is; maybe what the date is, especially while my phone is charging overnight."
5,"love my gshocks this is actually my third gshock. my dad, my brother and i all have them, because they are the only one we have found that can last up to all the fishing, camping, swimming, hiking, hunting, cooking and construction, as well as everything the army can throw at it. this one in particular is my personal favorite, sleek and stylish, it fits into any situation. 10/10 recommend"
5,"Great Bag Awsome bag, awsome quality, that’s what you should go for for a backpacking trip."
5,"My Friend Absolutely Loved It Great craftsmanship.  Amazing packaging.  Super cute gift that will be received well."
5,"Excellent temp control and performance Had it for 2 months now and very happy. Installed it myself to replace a 20yo GE radiant. All you've heard about induction is true. Only complaint is touch controls make it easy to inadvertently turn off burners if you errantly rest your hand on the control area and sensor will shut off burner if you swirl a pan for an omelette too long."
5,"Beautiful I am loving these necklaces! There's one for every outfit. The length is easily adjustable. These necklaces are well made, and very pretty. Keep some for yourself, and give some as gifts!"
5,"Favorite pants! Adidas does it right with these pants.  I love, love them.  I wear them both for working out and for casual weekend or afterwork relaxing.  The pants are lightweight and fit wonderfully.  I coach soccer and all the players wear them for warm up gear because of the easy side zipper to pull off over their cleats.  These are not heavy material for cold, cold weather if that is what you are looking for.  If I need that I will put legging on under and that is perfect for me."
5,"Warmest thickest sweats for women I was a little Leary with the product coming from China and slow shipping . But what I received was the warmest and thickest sweatpants I could find for my wife . Trust me , underarmour nor Nike have nothing that compares .  I was looking for the thick wool Sweats as seen on tv where women from the Chinese mountain regions are known to wear . And these were them in my opinion.  Not cheap garbage ."
5,"Five Stars Perfect"
5,"Great for ""that time of the month"" when I want ... Great for ""that time of the month"" when I want to freshen up more than once a day. I spray it onto my panties and it works nearly all day!"
2,"not worth it Thin and definitely no-show, but they don't stay up (despite the silicon patch not he heel) and they barely even act as a barrier between your foot and your sneaker.  Pointless."
3,"Has some flaws This product is okay.  It is meant to go with the Boon grass.  However, it doesn't stick in very well.  I have moved that thing all around trying to get it to go in and stay sturdy.  It just doesn't happen.  Also, you can't use every branch at once.  You can only use a few of the branches staggered apart from each other.  This was very inconvenient for me as I have twins and needed these to function a lot more efficiently."
1,"Don't waste your money Don't waste your money, this one will destroy your printer! It doesn't work, even after you align your printer upon installing this new cartridge it won't print properly. You will end up wasting a lot of paper hoping that the next page will be ok but it's a waste of money."
1,"Came with a broken seal. My product came unsealed. It specifically said on the bottle “Do not use this product if the seal is broken” typically I wouldnt be so picky, but regarding the area it’s used for I’m trying to figure out how to get my money back now."
4,"I’m a Pro Music Producer: Outstanding sound, delivers on performance, but no wireless charger These in-ears sound so great that this is now the third pair that I have purchased. The first two pairs were banded Coulax, but they are identical and also sound great. Anyone that complains that the sound is poor or there is no bass; has either not inserted them properly into the ear canal, used the wrong sized tips for their ear canal, or unfortunately just has the wrong sized ear canal for these types of in-ears. Pro tip: to help get them in your ear with a good seal, first put the rubber tips close to your mouth and breath some warm moist air onto them. Then immediately push them into your ear canal while the tips are still slightly moist.  I own custom IEMs from 64 ears, and Ultimate Ears along with many Audiophile grade over the ear headphones and I will tell you that these give all of them a run for the money - especially at the price point, and especially with the convenience of no wires. I use them daily and have been so thrilled with them.  I have also noticed that the one issue I had with the earlier Coulax branded versions, has been resolved in these. The old ones would occasionally lose audio in one ear; usually if I am bending down to pick something up or tie my shoes. It was a problem with both pairs that I owned. In these there appears to be no issue so far, and the range is truly impressive - I was able to wander around my 1200 square foot recording studio, that has 3 feet thick walls, and maintain the connection to my phone that I had left in the control room.  My only gripe is that the pictures show the wireless charger for the case, which is one of the reasons you would buy these over the standard E18. I wrongly thought that the wireless charging base was included, but was disappointed to find upon unboxing, that it is not. This is the only reason I have deducted one star. It should either be included, and option made to include the charging base, or abundantly clear that you will need to purchase one. Nevertheless, and outstanding product at a great price!"
4,"As promised. Looked great on my olady"
5,"Lightweight, comfortable, holds a lot, and folds to small packet Love this pack.  I need something lightweight to carry snacks and a change of clothes when I am out and about with my grandson, or to throw my towel and bathing suit in when I go to a friend's pool, etc.  Great for carrying small items when I am biking too.  I really like the fact that it folds up so small.  We travel a lot, and I need a day pack for the raincoat, camera, water bottle etc.  It folds down to nothing, and won't take up any room in the suitcase.  I live in New Orleans, and really gave it a workout as I attended all seven days of Jazz Fest.  It carried a lot while I biked back and forth to the venue, and wore it all day long.  The chest strap was great while carrying the occasional heavier than usual load.  I purchased mine in olive green.  Good color for a guy.  I liked it so much, that I just ordered one for my wife (in light blue). She needed a small backpack to take on our camping trip to Northern Michigan, followed by Toronto and Niagara Falls.  For under twenty bucks, how can you go wrong?  With a lifetime warranty?  Great value."
5,"GOOD VALUE Got this to replace an OLD one that was worn but still working.  Can't beat a Timex - it just keeps on ticking!  Especially like the mesh band on this one (I don't like the resin bands at all).  The Velcro ""clasp"" makes it easy to wear."
5,"Not too heavy, not too bulky I love the design, always a fan of the skeleton type of watches. It's fits well after taking a few links off, and the package provides the little tool to easier push out the pins, a definite plus.  The quality seems really good and will be wearing this for my special occasions."
5,"Can I give it 10 stars I absolutely love this top.  Great for running around and going to the gym.  For reference I’m 5,6 and have 38 DD chest.  I started weight watchers and have lost 17 pounds and plan on losing 25 more.  There is enough stretch that I feel confident it will still fit."
5,"Buying another one This thing is awesome. I was looking for a very light longer hoodie, it’s exactly it! If you want a heavier or medium fabric- it’s not for you. It’s is literally t-shirt fabric."
5,"Great watch for the price Watch is an excellent timepiece for the price.  I have had Casio watches for many years, and this one performs very well.  The price of the watch is very reasonable."
5,"This product is a blessing I had a yeast infection for 2 months. I went through 4 doses of the oral prescription yeast infection pills, 2 monistat treatments (one 1-day and one 3-day) nothing could get rid of my yeast infection. My doctor recommended this product and it worked over night. I will say is causes a weird odor and excessive amounts of discharge (I woke up and thought I peed myself) while doing the treatment.  Not sure if what I had was a normal reaction but I suggest wearing a pad to sleep when you use this product. Overall I am extremely happy to be feeling normal down there again. I will definitely buy this again and recommend to my friends."
5,"AMAZING!! I bought this watch for my husband's birthday! I couldn't wait to give it to him!! He absolutely loves this watch. It's a beautiful piece!"
5,"Five Stars Very good choice from us great services from amazon. Thank you"
5,"Super comfy lounge pant First of all this is not a yoga pant but it is super comfortable.  This is my new favorite lounge pant.  It is soft and have pockets.  I love pockets and while I won’t wear this to workout I will wear this for running errands and sitting on couch.  Sizing is correct.  I normally wear a small and the small fits perfectly.  The material is light but definitely not see thru."
5,"Love It I searched and searched for a back pack that I felt I could take to Europe and not fear that it could be easily broken into. I couldn't decide between the Pacsafe 35L and 25L. 35L seemed to be too big because I wanted to use the pack to carry on the airplane and as a day pack. However, it needed to be light and big enough to carry my tablet, a jacket, some snacks, my wallet, and some travel books as well as be comfortable and handy to carry. I even wanted to be able to fit my travel purse into it if I needed to. I finally decided on the 25L, and I am so glad I did. It is plenty big enough. It has not only chest straps but waist straps too and the back has a comfortable back pad as well. It has Pacsafe locks that are semi hidden away making it more difficult for a would-be thief to access, and if I want to add another little lock for the pocket with passports, etc.. I can. It is the perfect size and I love the color, something besides black."
5,"Ladies you need this backpack! I love this backpack! I have been searching for months for the perfect backpack. It’s lightweight, has many compartments, water resistant, &amp; durable for the price. I have looked at many other laptop backpacks but none of them were feminine enough or stylish. The gold zipper against the black nylon like material looks expensive! Only thing i would change is if the shoulder straps could have been a little more padded but overall I would definitely recommend this backpack."
5,"Great Exactly what I expected, love the different settings. I was able to make sauce with the puree setting as well instead of having to buy a food processor"
2,"Damaged! First pair of shorts were damaged! Replaced with another pair."
3,"On a scale of 1 to 10 I give it a four Good fit but shows everything if you have satellite it will show it"
3,"Digs into neck. This might be more comfortable if you are not large busted. The problem is as it supports any weight, that weight pulls down and it digs in. It doesn’t distribute the weight well at all. It’s cute but I can only wear it for short periods."
1,"Really disappointed with the quality Really disappointed with the quality. After 20 days of purchase we tried to prepare our first smoothie with this blender and guess what the glass is cracked from top to bottom. The smoothie was flowing everywhere. Now its pretty much useless. I wish to have my full refund. Would not recommend it..."
1,"Poor quality, ripped while putting on. At first I liked them because they actually kept my feet fairly warm. Today is the 3rd day I have worn them and while pulling the sock up it ripped! Apparently poor quality. Disappointed and won't recommend."
4,"A Lovely Little Ring I simply wanted a silver ring with a thin band to wear to my daughter's wedding in March so I took a chance with this ring. It was only $10 so I wasn't expecting too much but was happily surprised with the quality of the ring. It's very pretty, with small simulated diamonds. It arrived on time and came in a nice box so it was presented very well. I will definitively consider purchasing from them again."
4,"Effective vent - minor rattle in high winds The wall vent is easy to install and allows great air flow.  It is connected to a new Samsung Microwave and provides much more airflow than a powerful hair dryer.  It is hard to find these 6 inch vents now that home construction has slowed.  None of the majors or local hardware stores carry this type anymore.  The flap closes when the vent fan is off and keeps out flying insects. One minor issue with this type of vent is a minor rattle when a strong wind blows the auto closing flap.  A strong spring could prevent that rattle but would reduce air flow."
4,"Everything I'm looking for in a ""beater"" This was my first automatic watch. I wanted something a little more sophisticated than my Timex Easy Reader while still saving money for a much nicer watch (Nomos). The watch feels very nice, a definite upgrade in every category possible. Basically a poor man's Hamilton Khaki.  One thing I highly recommend is getting a new strap as soon as you get it. The strap that it comes with is not the greatest."
5,"The Only Bottle My Breastfed Baby Will Take I tried a total of seven bottles for my breastfed baby to use at daycare, and the MAM bottles are the only ones she would take. The unique nipple shape allows her to not have to open her mouth as much as with other bottles, which I suspect sealed the deal on these being her favorite bottles. If you're in the same situation I was in, I highly recommend giving these a try."
5,"Strong, durable, and holds really well I bought this to hold up some LED lights in the back of my gaming monitor. I must say, it is actually way stronger than I needed it to be. After adhering my LED strips to my monitor, I thought i'd readjust the positioning, but nope they did not budge an inch. This tape is the real deal. It will definitely stick where you need it to stick and hold stuff completely still. I cannot wait to use them on other things around the house."
5,"Pandora charm Hermoso! Auténtico Pandora."
5,"93 count Carefree pantiliners Having tried other brands I find myself coming back to Carefree. These extra long unscented panty liners are longer than the other ""extra long"" brands that I have bought. Great protection and they stay put until you remove them. Each liner is individually wrapped making them easy to tuck into your pocket or purse."
5,"I am ASTOUNDED how good these ear buds are Sounds quality is great, and they do provide noise cancellation as well.  Battery life is amazing.  I have been using them for 2 hours a day for nearly a month and they are still over 70% charged.  Very comfortable as well, and feel so secure in my ears.  The opposite of the over-priced Air Pods I lost and don't miss.  Wireless charging and can use as a portable power source?  At this price? Again, astounding!!  These buds have to be the best value out there!!"
5,"works!!!!!! Completely cleared up my BV in 2 days, easy to use and the price is right....amazing product!"
5,"Calmer My midwife recommended I try this product when I was peri-menopausal. After about 60 days, I noticed my mood swings were not as drastic and I felt calmer.  After menopause, I went off of it and had a serious case of hormone rage. Within 60 days, I was feeling more myself. I am taking this in combination with a prescription but I'm not changing a thing as it's working.  I tell all the peri-menopausal women I can about this product as it works!"
5,"love it I love this backpack- way better than I expected, can't wait to use it on my trip !"
5,"Great gift My girlfriend loves it than you and perfect fast delivery."
5,"Only bottle 3 month old will take We’ve tried basically every bottle for my 3 month old who is exclusively breastfed and have had most luck with this bottle! Last week she latched on 3 different times/days so that’s exciting!!"
5,"Worth losing counter space for it So much easier and convenient than the Dr. Brown's bags that I used for my first pregnancy. It is big, but it is worth losing counter space for you have such a convenient item. Other brand bottles and my pump parts did well in it too!"
5,"One of the best designs out there for a ""onebag"" carryon convertible backpack/shoulder bag. Max carryon size. Great looking in black. The smooth-finish, semi-ballistic weave exterior isn't too shiny, it just has a nice low-gloss sheen, but it sheds pet fur unlike ""canvas"" style fabrics.  The laptop slot is ingenious - the side towards my back is well-padded, as expected, but the side on the interior is unpadded, allowing the fabric to drape around the laptop edges, and thereby ""reclaim"" otherwise lost laptop compartment space.  This is a classic, albeit well-designed and beautifully made, ""onebag"" - a term coined by blogger Doug Dyment to describe convertible suitcase/backpack carry-ons that are efficient enough to replace checked luggage. Rick Steves has also been a big advocate of the ""carryon only"" philosophy and rectangular (for maximum interior volume) convertible backpacks.  This AmazonBasics is virtually a clone of the eBags TLC Mother Lode Weekender Convertible, which is a good thing - I've had both years-ago and recent Motherlode editions, and they are cleverly designed. My one gripe about the Motherlode line is ""feature creep"" - too many compartments, clever but hard to use snap-out water bottle slots, etc.  SO the AmazonBasics is a slightly simpler version of the Motherlode - for about half the price.  Size is maximum carryon size based on United Airlines' spec - 9x14x22. Unlike a lying wheelie, however the AmazonBasics is really 9x14x22 - wheelie makers usually don't count their wheels or protruding top and side handles (the handles on this AmazonBasics lie pretty flat).  Main compartment has tie-down straps that come straight off the bottom edge, compared to eBags which are routed through clips up the sidewalls first. Tie down straps off the bottom edge tend to compress packing cube edges more than their flat tops, pulling the packing cube edges away from the sidewalls.  The only interior organizing slot/pouch is a flat 2/3 width, flat mesh zipper pouch. I think this should have been full width.  Outside, there are two slots. The outermost slot is ""flat"" with zipper slight below the actual slot top. This is mostly good for - LOL - magazines (actually printed magazines? yeah, right) or a newspaper, stuff that isn't too thick. I'd be reluctant to even shove a scarf in here  Behind the flat zipper slot is a real ""compartment"", basically an add-on to the lid but accessible from the outside. It opens with a u-zipper, pulling down from the top (no opening side-to-side book style). You can fit a light wind or rain jacket in here, but fleece or a hooded rain parka will create a bulge. There are two pen slots on the body-side panel, with drop in solid slots at top and drop in mesh slots at bottom. These are designed for flat items; an Amazon Fire HD 8 without a case fits easily. I don't think any of the slots here are suitable for phone or passport, you should have a waistpack, neck pouch, or ""personal item"" sized handbag or small daypack for stuff that needs organizing.  Me, I only care about room for the following: 1. Packing cube for a couple travel pants and couple polos or short sleeve sport shirts; 2. Combination packing cube for underwear and socks. 3. Room for light sweat pants or longjohns, and light fleece, for pajamas. 4. Bathroom kit, in a dopp kit-style sil nylon zip pouch. 5. Chargers and cables kit. 6. Laptop and tablet (ok, in this case the front panel drop-in table slot is handy). 7. Left over room for a fleece and rain shell spread top to bottom in the interior main compartment. and Thin fabric shelled, t shirt weight lined, casual runners or hikers jacket in the external zipper compartment, to keep me warm on the flight.  So, basically, I can underpack this thing outbound, using the handy exterior compression straps to keep stuff from shifting and also to slim down the profile (which makes gate check agent happy). Inbound, I loosen the compression straps, unzip the expansion panel, and stuff the bag with souvenirs - and treat it as checked luggage when I leave, knowing that if it is temporarily lost I'll already be home and can live without it for a while.  $49.95 is a crazy price. This is worth $99 and would still be a bargain compared to name brands."
5,"very easy to carry outside I use this blender to make oren cookie milkshake for chilren. It does an excellen job. I really like that it's small easy and convenient to use. I love that it is glass so it's nice and chic and the color is beautiful，I can make my smoothie on the go anywhere，It is also easy to clean ，very impressed。"
2,"Poor design, plastic bits can get into your food. It worked OK at first. One day the blade got off center due to a piece of fruit and it scored the plastic. The cut is so deep it almost went all the way through. Before I realized what had happened I had already consumed the drink, plastic pieces and all. Now there is a rough ridge all along the inside where germs can collect if not cleaned with a brush. I don't think they thought it through, making the blade pivot on a small nub positioned in the center of the container. In am shopping for a new smoothie blender right now as I have been using my Oster Blender over this Ninja. My blender is just too hard to clean and too large, although it is glass and I am secure knowing pieces of plastic wont be shaved off into my next smoothie."
3,"Nipples show through shirts So I bought two of these bras, had to keep the blue one because it wasn't ""return eligible"", and it wasn't worth the hassle of going through customer service to try and return it. It fits as expected, I'm a size 36B and ordered the medium, it's just perfect. Only problem I have with it is that the lining isn't thick enough so your nipples show through your shirt, making it impossible for me to wear it to workout at the gym. I wore it to bed last night and it was extremely comfortable. Quality seems good, no annoying seams digging on your skin. Overall it's a good bra, just not good for the gym."
1,"Do not buy I was excited waiting for these to use on my Keurig 2.0 and what do you know????  They do NOT work. The Keurig is not accepting them. Very frustrated."
1,"Won’t last 7 months. Not worth the money. Ordered this stick in May 2019. Have used it several times to make soups with and was very happy with it until now. It’s November 2 2019 and it won’t turn on. No reason this should happen avfter only 7 months. The window to return it is closed and now I have to purchase another blending stick to make my soups with."
4,"Good quality These definitely aren't among the higher quality bankers boxes that you can purchase but if something basic with decent strength is good enough then these will do."
4,"Did it's job I was scared that it was going to be cloudy, but it wasn't. There are three reasons that someone would buy this; they need it for a stadium event, their/their child's school requires it, or they like the aesthetic. I was the last one. If you're planning on using it every day, be warned the plastic is thin. I used it for school for about 3 months before the bottom corners ripped (I have had an issue with backpacks ripping in the past so it might be a personal problem). If you're only using it occasionally for sporting events or concerts it's a great product."
4,"Good Microwave So far, so good.  Works great for the microwave.  Not sure how to use the grill portion of it and there are no instructions on how to use it or any suggestions for it that come with the microwave.  I've found some references by searching online from other consumers but no detailed info."
5,"Bold! This brews a truly bold cup of coffee. I like my coffee really strong. The darker the roast the better! Double Diamond has become a new favorite. As a reference I also really like Green Mountain Dark Magic, Tully's Italian Roast and Starbucks French Roast. I would say that Double Diamond is an even darker roast than those three."
5,"Decadent and delicious coffee This is our favorite kind of coffee. It’s strong and rich, and I can even enjoy it without creamer or sweetener."
5,"Why didn’t I buy these from amazon before? So many tampons and so much money saved"
5,"Great product! Makes it very convenient to have a ... Great product! Makes it very convenient to have a guest come by my house without having a doorman. The lock at the top makes it easier to put this lock box in inconspicuous places such as behind an outside door or on a rail tucked away from the elements and strolling pedestrians eyes. I would not leave it out with a key while unused since I'm not sure about rusting and the dials.  I had an issue with the passcode combination and the manufacturer was very kind and helped me out through the entire purchase. I highly recommend!"
5,"Great organization Got this for traveling and work and I love it"
5,"This watch is extremely good looking, feels great in the arm This watch is extremely good looking, feels great in the arm, easy to set up size fitting. Keeps good time, the time needs to set up every time you put it back on but hey, its's an automatic and don't use it all the time. I owned other high end watches which are automatic as well but they're on self winder box while not on use. I'm very happy and totally love it. So glad I bought it."
5,"Comfortable, great sound, secure fit, great design I have tried a number of blue tooth ear phones over the last year, trying to find one that checks all my boxes. Finally! I found a set that does. These head phones have superior sound quality, are easy to use, and best of all, are comfortable. I was a little concerned that they might not stay in, but the stay in better than any I have tried, even better than a pair with over the ear hooks. It is so nice not having any cord whatsoever. PLUS, the charging case they come in is sleek and secure. No chance of it popping open and dumping the ear phones. SO WELL ENGINEERED!"
5,"Great watch Beautiful timepiece. Everything it claimed to be.  Absolutely beautiful on my wrist. On a personal note, I took the watch to have  it sized. No real issues. Had two links removed still a little too loose. Had a third link removed and a bit too snug for me.  Called Seiko and asked if they made a half link for the SSG010 and they said no. I was surprised that they did not for such a great watch. A bit disappointed for me but not a deal breaker."
5,"No regrets Very high quality product. A bit thick, but suits my taste."
5,"Very HOT Panty for Men And Women!!! I Just Should have Ordered a Size Larger!"
5,"Beautiful Piece I normally buy jewelry for my mom and my girlfriend in person rather than online - for obvious reasons. But I found this necklace and thought it looked amazing online so I bought it. It came in great packaging and my girlfriend absolutely loved it. If the recipient liked rose-gold this is definitely a piece that I would recommend."
5,"Nice Little Watch I do a lot of hiking,and rock climbing, and after damaging a $90 crystal on my favorite watch, by brushing it up against a rock, I was looking for something that wouldn't cost me a fortune if I damaged it, and this watch is perfect. The band also fits snug, while being comfortable."
5,"My new microwave Love it☺"
2,"Much lower cut than expected! These socks are comfortable  in the footbed area, the only problem I have with them is they are lower cut than advertised. I wanted ankle socks, these sit quite a bit lower so they don't protect my ankles from being rubbed from my shoes. Unfortunately, I wash things before I put them on me, so I can't return them. If you're looking for an ankle sock, this is not what you're looking for, these are great quality but are definitely on the lower cut version versus the ankle that they advertised."
3,"Better than most...I guess Held up better than the other ones we've tried.  But it did start to break apart after about 6 weeks..purchased the 4 yr warranty but can't seem to get customer service to respond to me on how to exchange it"
1,"Not even leather! Clearly a knock-off. It doesn’t even seem to leather, or a good simulated leather. Returning ASAP."
1,"Lasted less than a standard cartridge I saw mixed reviews and took a chance. Purchased on 05/06 and it's now 06/28 and it's out of ink. My household doesn't use the printer every day, nor uses it for a large number of copies. Very light use and to have an XL cartridge last for less than 60 days is ridiculous. My standard cartridges have last much longer."
1,"Bland, essentially tasteless. A waste of time and money! I had high expectations for this variety pack, but there is NO discernable flavor in any of the six blends sampled so far. A caring person contacted me to find how I liked their product. When I replied that there was no flavor, the representative promised me a full replacement variety pack at no additional cost. Weeks have passed with no further communication and no promised coffee replacement. It seems there is one person who cares for making customers into repeat customers. She is seemingly alone among a group of folks packaging something called ""coffee"" but should more accurately be called ""recycled and abused morning warm drink."" Please spend your money on anything BUT this product!"
4,"If you like dark roast... Very dark and drinkable, while the batch I received was not quite the taste I remembered... I chalked this up to maybe not being roasted long enough for the cases I received. I have always loved this roast and will give it a second chance in the future as I really loved it in the past!"
4,"Four Stars works fine great price"
5,"Love the variety Love these all came intact"
5,"A NICE PRODUCT I really like using this headphone. This is not heavy and very smart look. It connects the phone very easily. Sound quality and the battery life is also very good overall a good product."
5,"Stunning This was purchased as a gift.  The recipient really liked it.  It is a beautiful timepiece.  We needed to take some links out of the band as it was too big, but once that was done it fit nicely.  It took a few hours for the time to set to the appropriate time zone but it did it itself and no hassle."
5,"The instruction manual could be a little clearer on the button controls Used it for doing ebooks from the library.  In general, range seemed to be about 30 feet (less if walls) from the transmission source.  Worked great for mowing or other ""loud"" activities.  Used the earbuds instead of the primary foam noise suppressors I normally use, and the covered them with full ear sound muffs.  Cut the noise and made the activity go so much faster being about to ""read"".  Battery seems to last for about 6 hours this way until you begin to get ""battery low"" verbal message.  This happens for about 30 minutes, occurring at maybe 5 min intervals before it shuts down.  Would definitely recommend!"
5,"Great for my commute I commute for work into the city and this has been great. Note that it does not come with a battery pack for charging your phone, but does include the cables. I have worn this through rain and it has done a good job keeping things dry. There are enough adjustments to make this comfortable carrying, and it breathes well in hot weather compared to others to minimize sweating. There is plenty of storage space and the side pockets are very functional for water bottles, thermos or umbrella. I have no complaints at all."
5,"These are great! When these arrived, I thought they would be too thin, but they are actually just perfect!  And they stay up inside my boots, which is what I was hoping for.  I have purchased Hanes for years, but the last pack of those I got are poor-fitting and won't stay up - a real waste of money.  These are just great: soft, comfy, stretchy, and warm.  I have washed them repeatedly and they are just as good-fitting as when I first got them.  Love them!"
5,"Works great with the Panda Planner I happen to have a older Paper Mate Flair Felt Pen sitting around. It worked great on my Panda Planner. It did not bleed through and you don't really see it on the next page. I ordered a whole set and they work great in my Panda Planner."
5,"So cute Perfect! It thins and dainty. I got this because I gm nine months pregnant and needed a place close to my heart for my wedding ring while my hands are swollen. I love it!"
5,"Five Stars Awesome watch. Edited after a couple months of use... I live in warm climate and noticed that the watch gets pretty warm during the day. The manual says don't expose to the sun for extended periods but there is nothing you can do about it if you're in TX or on vacation at the beach. It's a little concerning but otherwise the watch is still pretty awesome."
5,"Nice watch nice price Great watch, feels good works great"
5,"My daughter likes it Very cool! My child enjoys playing with her dolls"
5,"Loves it He loves it"
5,"Giftable Super cute, comes in a gift box. Has different color felt circles to match outfits or match to scents. I’m on the fence about gifting or keeping because I like it so much. The tree of life design is perfect."
2,"Not as described. Greatly disappointed, I thought the petite would fit properly since I am only 5 ft tall, the waist is right under my boobs just like other regular pants, the length is also too long, dragging on the ground a few inches. I expected them to be a better fit after washing but still the same and now I can't return them, boo hoo, I bought 3 pair, 1 hasn't arrived yet, I will return that unwashed pair.  In my opinion these are NOT PETITE as described."
3,"Gathers water if lid not removed after sterlization Collects a lot of water during steaming process. You can't leave bottles in to dry because it will grow mold. You have to make sure to take them out/remove lid to dry which defeats the purpose of sterilizing in my opinion. Also started to grow mold on the rack because we did not leave the lid off/open between uses. Wouldn't recommend."
3,"Great fitting shirt The printing on this shirt is  starting to break up a little bit, other then that it is a great shirt"
3,"A lot of work The blender was delivered more than a month after order. The directions require unplugging every time before the cover is opened; failing this, a button could be brushed and accidentally put the contents on the ceiling. The small cap on top does not have a positive stop to lock it in place; user needs to feel where is seems a little harder to turn. The blades do not have a gentle start, even on lowest speed. Everything gets splashed to the top, where some of it may not trickle back into the mix. User needs to have a rubber spatula at hand to push the splashed contents down."
1,"Honest opinion, The quality of this bag is not worth of $80. I read many good review on this bag. That's why I bought it. However, after touch this bag for 5 minutes, I decided to return it with ""no regrets"". The material of the bag is really hard and rough.  It feels like a harden plastic that will be tear apart in a short time. The bag looks nice from outside. But when you touch it. You will change your mind on the quality of this bag. The zipper is hard to deal with. The only good thing about this bag is the inside. It was nice. Over all, This bag is not worth of $80 at all. It is over pricing. I bought it at $60. I feel it is still over pricing."
4,"Baby loves them, less gassy. The market lines on these bottles are. It correct.  I dumped 2 oz in one bottle and then in these bc my daughter kept spitting up and the 2 oz line should be at 2.5 oz line."
4,"noisy whisk attacment Whisk attachment very loud, blender attachment is quiet. Seems well made but is heavier than my old one that finally died."
4,"Felt safe and secure. I wish it had  pocket on the strap in front for easy  access to a dollar or 2.  Also chest strap option. Love the material.  Caught in rain and dried quickly. Put strap around table let while snoozing on beach."
5,"Saves! Work Great, Saves messes and little ones over using glue. I loved the 30 pack! I was able to buy 1 pack and split them between my kids for each of their classes. Save me time and Money! Win! Win!"
5,"Excellent replacement for single use K-cups! Bought these 3-4 months ago to restrict my spending on K-cups. I usually only buy environmentally friendly products when they are also friendly with my pocket. These reusable K Cups not only save me money, but they do it without any downsides. I usually buy coffee in bulk from Costco which I think costs me a 10th in price for the same amount of cups or maybe even less. Not only do you have a choice with these to save money, but also to use any coffee you want. The mesh on these is quite fine. The amount of ground coffee that appears in your cup of coffee is minimal if any. Clean up is easy. I pop them in the dishwasher all the time. Me and my wife have been using them twice daily without problems. There are no signs of wear so far.  I can only compare these to Keurig K-cups and not any reusable K cups because these are the only reusable ones I've ever used and I see no reason in the foreseeable future to try others because these are showing no signs of failure any time soon."

5,"Great price - Awesome Earpods The buds are very comfortable for extended use periods, and stay in place. My use case is typically to use them while working in my home office at my computer, and for all purpose. The sound quality surprised me somewhat, as the base is deeper and more clear. Overall, whether I'm listening to classical, jazz the sound reproduction is excellent. They are certainly not heavy and compared to wireless bluetooth headsets, don't seem to me to be big.  The buds are also great for my daily walks or gym activities. They provide a good seal between the ear and most ambient noise. I also appreciate the fact that the amount of external noise is balanced, as I like to walk on the side walk trails and I can hear them approaching while still enjoying my music playlist. So, for indoor or outdoor use, I give 5* rating  Build quality is excellent. The charging case is well designed and durable. I keep mine in a carrying case. I've just charged once and used the buds for more than 25 times with up to 2-3 hours daily.  Given the quality, features and sound reproduction of these buds, the price is fair, at least to me."
5,"A Durable Wrist Watch with Excellent Features for a Great Price The Casio Men's A178WA-1A Illuminator Stainless Steel Watch is an excellent wrist watch for the price.  It displays the time, day, month, and date.  It features a stop watch and displays the time for an alternate time zone.  The watch includes the option of displaying the time in either 12-hour mode or 24-hour military mode.  The watch features the standard built in light for illuminating the time in the dark and comes with a ten year battery.  The metal watch comes with a stainless steel wrist band.  I ordered this Casio wrist watch to replace a Timex wrist watch, which had developed a problem with the battery contacts.  Although Timex offered a repair service, the representative from Timex informed me that the cost of the repair could range anywhere from $10 to $30.  For that price, I knew that I could easily purchase a new wrist watch.  This Casio wrist watch included all of the same features (plus one extra) as my old Timex did but cost only half as much as a comparable new Timex.  There were many other watches within the price range of this Casio wrist watch which included similar features; but, most of those wrist watches were made out of plastic.  In the past, I had owned plastic watches which had broken; so, I had always since preferred metal watches because of their durability.  I had seen other metal watches within the price range of this Casio watch; but, most of those other watches included fewer features.  The Casio wrist watch arrived only eight days after it was ordered.  It came in a box which included an instruction booklet.  Within minutes, I was able to set the time on the watch and to put it on.  This watch does have one minor shortcoming  When setting the time, the display does not indicate whether the displayed hour is AM or PM.  However, once the time is set, the watch can be quickly switched from 12-hour mode to 24-hour military mode to check whether the time is set in AM or PM.  If the time is off by 12 hours, it can easily be reset.  However, this is a minor issue; since, the time may not have to be reset again for a number of months.  The Casio wrist watch does not allow the user to set the day of the week.  Instead, the watch has the user set the year when setting the other calendar functions.  Although the year is not normally displayed, the year setting does control the day of the week that is displayed for a particular calendar date.  This means that the wrist watch automatically adjusts for leap years, which is really nice.  Overall, I am very pleased with this Casio men's wrist watch.  It seems to keep time accurately and appears to be very durable.  I would highly recommend this particular brand and model to anyone who is looking for reasonably priced metal watch which offers a nice set of features."
5,"BEST bottle brush I've used several bottle brushes since my son was born, and this is the sturdiest bottle brush and does the job, plus it looks good too. The extra attachment is handy, too, and cleverly designed.  Thank goodness Oxo sells a non-baby one (which I also purchased), because my husband likes this brush so much he's using it to clean out the coffee pot each morning."
5,"Nice Very nice calendar."

5,"Beautiful, stylish back pack! I am not a big fan of backpacks! But after the airline made me check my hard sided carryon due to not enough space in the cabin of the plane, I decided it was time to look into one. I was not happy that I had to check my legal size carryon instead of being able to bring it with me on a transatlantic flight. Some of the backpack that were allowed on were twice as big as mine and I looked around at the other passengers and realized many of them had back packs as their carry on’s- and large ones at that. I decided then and there that I was just going to have to get a backpack as my carryon. I did a lot of research and decided on this one. I love that it has a “doctors bag” style top opening. It opens all the way up and will stand up on its own while you load it up. Their are 2 big pockets on the inside for my iPad, makeup bag, a pair of Sandels or whatever else you might like. I was able to put a change of clothes, toiletry bag, my travel purse, make up bag, and brush bag. This holds quite a bit! You really can’t pack a lot of clothes but I primarily wanted this for things that I need to keep with me at all times. There is a nice size pocket on the out side for paperwork, a 2 other small zip pockets for keys or cell phone. The interior of the Navy bag is a bright,beautiful “Tiffany Blue” interior that makes it easy to find everything in the bottom. The bag is “touted” as a diaper bag and even comes with a changing pad but my years of babies are long gone. I tossed the changing pad and kept rolling. Once you have everything in it, you do need to hold the top closed while you zip it up but it does hold everything in very well. This is not a bulky backpack but is very sleek and clean looking. It is very organized which is what I wanted. It is a great bag for $37.00 and I would gladly spend the money on it again!"
5,"love it This is my favorite liner. Its not so thin it doesn't work, but not obvious or uncomfortable either."
2,"Molestia por la falta de una caja pulsera PANDORA Llegó el pedido de la pulsera Pandora, pero es de muy mal gusto recibirla en una bolsa y no en una cajita adecuada para regalar. Esto ha sido molesto porque pedí unos anillos y una cadena de menos valor y llegan con cajita. En la foto que adjunto aparece. Espero puedan mandarme antes de mañana una cajita para meter la pulsera y darla en su estuche. Gracias"
3,"No peri bottle I am 4 days post partum. Part of the reason I bought this was for the peri bottle. There is a space for it in the kit and its on the box, yet the item description does not have it. After reading other reviews saw that it does not come with it.  The cooling pads are cool but huge in your drawers. The best two are the foam and the wipes."

4,"Makes a good Kcup quality Espresso If you want good coffee shop quality espresso, maybe go to the coffee shop.  These cups will fulfill your craving if you cannot find your espresso fix another way.  We have been drinking these cafe bustelo cups for a couple of years. Occasionally we will get a batch that the Keurig machine doesn’t like. What I mean by that is the machine might only make a small cup because the contents of the Kcup might not penetrate the filter layer inside or the espresso mix may be under too much pressure, push espresso mix up into the water intake when you close the lid and gum up the machine. Just remember to clean your machine by running just hot water without any Kcup in the machine at least once a week."
4,"So far so good! So far so good! I will update my review if they don’t hold up after working out. So buttery soft and they aren’t too tight, just right. I’m 5’3” and around 130lbs and got a medium, I got the navy blue color and the savannah color and they look so pretty! Can’t wait to try them when working out. Update: I don't find these see through, I would recommend sizing down if you want more compression, might try a small next time. They do ride down but if you pull up on the pant leg part and fold the waist band they hold up fine. Not sweat proof, but I feel like that's common for lighter color leggings. Would buy again."
4,"So cute and easy to ear These are very beautiful earrings first off. I have very sensitive ears and these are very gentle and do not irritate my ears. They came in a cute box and are very nice quality. I would like to purchase other products from this brand considering how lovely these are for the price."
5,"High Value Timepiece Two things up front. First, I did not buy mine from Amazon. Secondly, I think the perfect rating for this watch would be a 4.5 but since I don't have that option, I will call it a 5. Very well put together with more functions then most people will need in a lifetime. Definitely aimed at the outdoor enthusiast. However, its elegant in its own way and I can see myself wearing mine to the office occasionally. As far as canvas straps go, this one is pretty good. I always find that its either a bit too tight or not tight enough. I guess I could punch my own hole(s) if I wanted to to. A little bit disappointed in the readability of the digital readout. A bit dim....with no option to increase the level of illumination, as far as I can tell. The regular ""light"" for reading the watch at night works fine. Again, I am really impressed with the overall build and functionality. Just spend 5-10 mnts in the guide, and you will be mastering the most important 70% of the watch's core functions in no time. Highly recommended."
5,"My new best friend My new best friend.  I definitely notice a difference when not taking these, I cry very easily these days going through the change.  We lost our dog in February and if I don't take these I cry multiple times a day thinking about him.  I've lost 5 other dogs but this one has been especially hard while navigating the change of life.  These keep me feeling calm and confident, not overly emotional as we tend to be with the change.  I've been taking them for 3-4 months and can't go without them for a few years anyway😊"
5,"Can't go wrong with Sharpie What can I say? They're Sharpies. They're the bomb. I use them for everything. Ever since I discovered you can rub off Sharpie ink with rubbing alcohol, I use them to write on my binders every semester. Doesn't rub off like dry erase markers, and at the end of the semester, I wipe with rubbing alcohol and start all over. My husband uses them the same way at work. I'll probably never use dry erase again."
5,"A gift for Grandma! Well made, very nice"
5,"Great Sport Earbuds at a Great Price These SoundPEATS True Shift earbuds are well made and durable. The batteries in the earbuds and charging case work well, with the earbuds holding a charge for about 3 hours. Included with the earbuds are 3 sets of different sized ear tips.  The earbuds work great for working out as they stay in your ears very well while running. They also have a IPX7 sweat-proof rating. They are also very comfortable to wear for extended periods of time.  The best thing about these earbuds is the SOUND.  These earbud have a neutral sound that is on the warm side with crystal clear sound at max volume.  The sound is amazing for this price.  To sum it up, these SoundPEATS True Shift true wireless earbuds sound great, are quite comfortable, and work well at a very reasonable price."

5,"As expected! Great looking range top, would recommend"
5,"Holy crap Batman this is so cheap compared to the last one I bought. Thanks Amazon The price is unbelievable the last one I bought was 5 times as much 4 years ago"
5,"Pretty cool This watch is super retro, rather big on a lady's wrist, but works well since it os adjustable and has a face that's really easy to read with large numbers. My only real complaint is that the LED light diesn't work very well because it only lights up a tiny bit of the watch face. Can be hard to read the minutes in the dark. Otherwise, I really love this watch. I'd recommend it!"
5,"This is the absolute BEST, no need to look further!!! Wow! The first thing you'll notice about this product is the amazing packaging. Of course the first thought you may have after that is, how much less could I have paid if it wasn't for the amazing, best in class type of packaging... but it was already a bargain price in my opinion, so it was really a win/win situation. I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this screen protector!!! They supply everything you need to ensure a hassle free, easy and accurate method of applying this quality product, including a unique, fool proof placement system. I have had many screen protectors over the years, some applied by professionals, and some applied by myself, but I have never had a tempered glass one before this, and I have never had a more satisfying result than the one I've had with this product. It is perfect in my opinion and I will never go anywhere else for a screen protector. Omoton rocks, and  I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THEM!!!"
5,"My favorite bra My favorite bra right now.  I'm petite and sometimes bras have too much space between cups.  This one is just right.  Tried one on at bra shop where a sales person fit me.  Bought one there and then came home and bought two more in different colors from Amazon sellers."
5,"Perfect Perfect"
5,"Five Stars Nice color just as expected."
2,"Don't believe the photo - No luggage strap The luggage strap as depicted in the 6th photo does not exist. I do not think it was a missing part, since there is nothing to clip it to. I think they just discontinued this feature, which is a must for a travel bag. I am returning. Also, the bag is huge, too big to qualify as a personal item on a plane. The rule is rarely enforced, but on a crowded flight, an attendant may say you have 2 carryons. As to the bag, it is very well made, but way too compartmentalized. 7 zippered pockets. If you are looking for something at the airport, you better have a good memory as to where you stashed it. Inside the zippered pockets, there are mort pockets. Ideal for someone with severe OCD, but not for me."
3,"Okay, but poor quality control. Products are as described. Could be a little thicker. One of the hanger tabs was actually glued on upside down - this one will be thrown away. Will try another brand next time. You can see how one side of the blue divider has the hook facing the opposite direction of the other."
1,"Disappointed So disappointing. Initially it looked like it worked well but every single thing we glued, with this glue, fell apart. It’s more like a wax for temporary tacking not for gluing."

5,"Nice gift My aunt loved them"
5,"Well worth every penny.  Good looking, too. My choices were either another cheap microwave, or go with Breville, my go-to brand these days for appliances.  I decided to splurge, and I’m glad I did.  When it came, the first thing I did was actually read the manual.  I figured if I actually use it for more than a quick warm-up, it will be worth the extra $$$.  After using it for a month or so, I can honestly say that I do, and it is.  My fave setting is sensor cook.  It’s a winner for quick-steaming vegetables of all kinds- less mess, and a fraction of the time.  I’ve done creamer potatoes, zucchini, broccoli, cauliflower carrots, etc.  They come out al dente- perfect for making large batches and having leftover finger food in the fridge.  I’ve also used it to defrost and re-heat, etc, but I eat a lot of veggies so that’s the huge labor saver for me.  No more steamer inserts and trying not to steam my hands when opening the lid after cooking them on the stove, no pots to wash.  Just a glass pie plate, which I cover with a plastic vented top made for microwaves."
5,"very nice discrete diamond stud very nice discrete diamond stud earring ... these are ""about"" the size of a BB (including mounting) and perfect for me as i don't generally want an earring that is obvious ... very much like ... would recommend especially if you get them on sale like i did"
5,"Super Range Hood Normally you would be a little skeptical on low price.  This hood rocks.  We purchased it because of the lighting in the back and the mechanical switches, plus looks good.  Before purchasing I asked the Amazon crowd if there was a damper to which a reply came back saying yes.  The hood does not have a damper but I was able to add one in line but I will spare the details.  The hood is quiet and works with my damper on all three fan speeds.  I'm pretty happy, I wasn't impressed with my local retailers as their displays were horrible and they didn't stock what I really wanted.  So, I shopped on Amazon.  Would definitely buy again and recommend to others.  Also, was missing a part and Cosmo customer service got me that part out right away.  That was super customer service."
5,"Fits really well I'm a size 14 and purchased the XL - it looked like a L when I pulled it out and it is slightly snug but I want it to be a little bit when working out so it doesn't ride down on me.  For reference - I'm 5'5' and 185"
5,"Perfect for my spectra s2 pump I needed a 9oz bottle that can hold more milk n would connect to my spectra pump without any additional adapter. This works great n seems like a good quality plastic bottle too."
5,"Quality above it's pricepoint Awesome watch for the price. Couldn't recommend more. Mine is 4 seconds a day fast which is very solid for a watch of this price, although it's not a guarantee you get one as accurate as mine. Threw on a new band and it has become my new favorite watch for everyday wear. If you need a beater watch to supplement an already solid collection or you want a watch to wear everyday like me, it's a solid option at an unbeatable price point."
5,"Great product, doesn't fade or tarnish Not bad, not bad at all. Doesn't fade or tarnish. I would recommend getting a picture of a CLOSER image. I had a family photo and it's kinda hard to see it. But if the orginial photo was taken closer it would of been perfect. For a single photo of 1 person it would be just fine."
5,"Beautiful Watch Beautiful watch my husband loved it!"
5,"Anyway she said it is a good fit for her as she has small wrists The only problem with my order is it took an extra 3 weeks to get to my daughter &amp; I bought it for her birthday. I believe the weather was some of the problem &amp; it came from the east coast to the mid west. Anyway she said it is a good fit for her as she has small wrists."
5,"The price. I love my watch, I have 5 of then ( citizen different models)  so I wear them for work and every day."
5,"Backpack love. High quality and usability. I have never had a backpack to compare with this one. It has nothing but useful compartments. I wouldn't change a thing which is amazing as I would almost always change any backpack, luggage or purse. This one can't be beat for its cargo space, its design, usability. It stands up making it easy to use both hands to access anything. It has lots of protection for your electronics and holds so much gear without creating lots of strain on your back. I carried it into Africa with most things that were necessities for a two week trip, including laptop, iPad, phone gear, water purification, medicines, food, several pair of glasses, writing materials, books, clothes. It is not huge but shaped to hold an unreal amount of stuff. The side There are multiple secure zippered compartments inside and out. The stretch mesh side pockets are tall enough to hold a large water bottle, enough for en entire day. Unlike all my previous backpacks this one caused no back pain. They have well-engineered how the weight is distributed. It is well padded on the back. I am 5'7"", 120# and was able to carry more than my sturdier companions. And, I am no jock. I love this so much I am buying another so that if this ever gets lost or destroyed that I won't have to deal with an inferior product. I can't imagine anyone finding this product disappointing. When not in use you can fold the entire thing flat which is pretty amazing for something that has good enough structure to stand whether is is full or half empty. Did I mention I love this backpack?!"
2,"Solimo Kona Blend....Meh..... This coffee did not appeal to me. To me, not a typical Kona blend - I felt it to be low in what I would call ""coffee"" flavor and aroma, and a bit of a bitter after-taste.  May be satisfactory to others, I dont know.  Brewed three and gave the rest away.  I am not a coffee snob - There are a lot of bargan k-cup varieties in the market - Some I have tried and enjoyed and and have bought repeatedley. Great idea to have an Amazon brand with some other choices that would be more suitable to my palate."
3,"Does Not Last Long at Full Illumination I really like the design of this booklight. It clamps on and doesn't let go. The neck is long and adjustable and works for all sizes of books. The microUSB port is right where it should be if you want to try charging while you're reading. (That's not among my favorite activities. If it has batteries, it should be mobile.) I'm going to see if I can find a way for it to fit on my ancient AluraTek eBook reader. If it does that, my 3.5 star rating will go to a solid 4.  The main issue for me is that I absolute need the brightest level of illumination, but the battery only lasts six hours that way. It takes a long time for the battery to charge. (If this battery can do ""quick charge,"" please feel free to correct me.)  Still, it's good for what it does and if it plays well with my eBook reader (doubtful), I may snag another one so I can have one charging while I read with the other.  Oh...I didn't realize there were colors other than black or I would have got one, probably. Why is black considered so stylish? When you lose it, it's hard to find and it shows every speck of dust."
3,"Hard to read LCD You can barely see the LCD, It is nowhere as bright as the product photos will have you believe . If there is a lot of direct light, you can see it fine . The hands are quite easy to read, but the face of the watch has the same lighting issues as the LCD.  Other than that, it's a cool looking watch , just not good for telling the time. Pretty rugged though. Added some photos in differing lighting so you can see what i mean"
1,"Exploding pods So far two boxes of this coffee has pods that explode in the cup holder.  They spill coffee grounds all over my coffee maker and counter and wall.  I would like to get reimbursed somehow.  It is not my coffee maker because I switched to Starbucks and so far have gone through two boxes of pods with no problems.  The seal on the top of the Peet's pods just lifts and the coffee grounds pour out."
4,"Works like a charm at hiding cords Pros: 1) Great price with easy installation; 2) I painted it to match my wall, and it looks great; 3) it does exactly as advertised.  Cons: 1) I had to cut down the cover because some of the power cords to my devices (digital antenna, smart Blu-Ray player) were not long enough to be held down to the top of the baseboards (at the bottom of the wall). By cutting six inches off the bottom of the cover, I was able to keep the two devices in place.  Summary: Make sure the power cords to the devices connected to your TV are long enough to prevent having to place them elsewhere or else you will have to cut the cover down to provide some slack to the cords."
4,"Nice addition I am pleasantly surprised- I love it"
4,"Great stretch shirt, but sizing is tricky I actually got a size larger than I should have because other reviews said that it ran very small.  Since I am generally a size Small to  Medium, (size 6-8) I figured a Large should be just right, because I do have a few large T-shirts that look OK.  But I got this shirt primarily hoping that it would be a snug fit, to be worn under a jumper.  The arms fit just right, but the shoulders and chest are just a big larger than I hoped for.  I should have ordered a size Medium.  But then again, it's possible that the upper arms might have felt too tight, as my upper arms are not exactly skinny.  I've decided to keep it because it will look fine enough under the jumper.  The stretch fabric is great and I couldn't find any navy blue stretch shirts in any store!"
5,"Perfect for short-term projects These are wonderful felt-tip pens to use for work or school.  Pros -thicker than the average pen -smooth writing (dont have to worry about running out of in) -does not bleed through standard notebook pages -writes like a marker, with all the perks of a pen  Cons -ink will gradually fade over time if used on things other than notebook paper (ie. Postcard faded in 1 year) -starts to get streaky when running out of ink -doesnt press with the same firmness of a ballpoint pen (if you do work with carbon copies)"

5,"GET IT. So history of my health. I have PCOS with hormonal acne and irregular to no periods and then bleed for long periods. Anyways, I've been taking it 2 months now and my breakouts have ABRUPTLY STOPPED! I recently got my menstrual cycle after not having it for a year and it seemed to be regulating that for me as well. Came with the cramps and everything! Before I never got cramps and it was a light flow whereas now its heavy and I'm cramping as I type this.  But I just had to come and say it WORKS. I will update with pictures of my skin and how it helped. I haven't been happy with my skin in years and finally, I am getting some kind of control over it."

5,"Great for Yeast Infection Treatment These pads stay nice and dry and were perfect when I had a yeast infection recently and treated it with Monistat.  These pads made that experience so much better because I felt cleaner, the pad stays in place and they are nice and thin and not rough against my skin like some natural ultra pads."
5,"Great value Great value"
5,"The Perfect Laptop Backpack What a great backpack! I was nervous purchasing this since there were no reviews yet, but it did not disappoint. It came exactly as pictured. It's the exact sleek, minimalist aesthetic I was looking for. It also fits my 15"" MacBook perfectly (as well as everything else I need - water bottle, umbrella, notebooks, etc.) Zero complaints!"
5,"This is definitely a bargain! There were a couple of pairs that were a little heavy but otherwise these are all very pretty!"
2,"Disappointing I was disappointed in these earrings and will be returning them.  They look cheap and the different colored little crystals all look the same color with the exception of one dark one.  I’m not impressed."
3,"UV Protection Issue Purchased for use on outdoor plastic plant name tags.  The Extreme version does hold up well to rain and similar harsh conditions, however it does not appear to have sufficient UV protection and fades extremely quickly in direct sunlight.  Within 3 weeks the writing faded by about 40% when placed outdoors in direct sun.  Tags not in direct outdoor sunlight held up well at the 3 week mark with no noticeable fading."
1,"Honestly no. I love honest. I wanted to love these tampons. I wasted at least 4 throughout the box because frankly they just would not go in. I woke up this morning to one falling apart as I removed it, and I'm done. So disappointed."
1,"Not as big as everyone says I asked like 3 times if my laptop (acer predator 15) could fit?  and everyone answered that it will fit. The big surprise is that my laptop barely fit in the zippered pocket but not in the specific compartments for laptops. So my laptop isn't  very protected. Keep in mind that the seller could lie or say anything  just to sell the product. In overall the backpack has good quality materials and looks pretty nice."
1,"Wasted money! Waste of money. The pieces don't fit together properly and doesn't close tight. Yea falls right out!"
4,"Not bad Not bad but wish there was something I could use that did not require washing the bottles first. The system is a little hard to clean if you don’t clean it after each use."
4,"Not great for running outside I run outside and, like other ear buds I have owned, these don't handle wind noise well (thus the 4 stars). They fit great with the smallest inserts (They kept falling out with the default inserts). The sound is great. Good battery life for the buds and the case. The buds are tricky to get out of the case because the magnets keep sucking them back into the slots and I can't get a good grip to pull them out the first time. No problems connecting with my phone. Once connected, I haven't lost connection. Because of the wind noise, I gave these to my wife and she loves them. I think I will have to pay more for better noise cancellation."
5,"Favorite shirt! Love this shirt! It’s seriously so comfy and one of my favorite. I plan to buy in more colors"
5,"i doubt you complaint I bought two of these guys one for me with the extended battery and this one without. for some reason, anything sound peat has a great battery life the sound is pretty good and the Bluetooth has a decent range to the fully wireless standard. the fitment is excellent and it comes in with a few adapters which you normally have to purchase separately on other brands. I first bought this brand because I was sick of losing and replacing expensive headphone but I'm on my fourth pair (still have the previous 3). only advised on this is that please read the instruction carefully but is minimal because the one you parry them once it becomes easy after but it could be tricky. but as I said with my previous ones can't go wrong with this ."
5,"Isaiah- amazing 5 STARS Well to be honest I wasn't goibg to leave a review cause I figured there wasn't a point, but i got an email asking to leave one so i will, I really enjoy the product itself and if it worked properly I would give it 5 stars.  But wheb I received tge ear buds they were ok it seemed.  They came with a charge and I used them till they died.  When I tried to put them into the charging case i noticed only one ear bud will charge.  I checked to see if it was the charging port or the ear bud and determined it was the ear bud.  Luckily I nornally only use a single ear bud. So I guess its bit the biggest deal although it would be nice if both buds worked properly.  Other than that i do like the product and have given it a fair reveiew I think EDIT: they actually,sent me a new set of ear buds, they work amazingly.  Thank you so much 5STARS"
5,"Great grinder The only issue I have with this is that it's really easy to overgrind your coffee beans into powder, for those who like a stronger cup of coffee this is great, for those who don't please try to use less coffee than you normally would."
5,"Exceeded Expectations Incredible!  My husband &amp; I managed to pack the vast majority of our clothes (it contains a plethora of zipped areas for a variety of purposes) into this bag.  Our trip was 13 nights in 3 countries on 4 separate airlines😳.  Between this backpack &amp; my carry-on, we never had to check in any bags😎  My husband, not a backpack carrier normally, was impressed with how comfortable it is to carry on his back and he loved the side handle as an alternative to wearing it on his back for shorter distances.  It easily carried both our formal clothes,  without wrinkling them, in addition to jeans and hiking boots.  Before next summer’s major trip, I’ll be purchasing one of my own. Good-bye checked bags for good! 👏🏽"
5,"Make excellent coffee at home. Love, love, love this French press coffee maker. I had never used one. My son recommended I try a  French press so I did some searching on Amazon and found the reviews for this particular coffee pot. I am extremely happy with my purchase. It works perfectly. I grind my own beans and I'm finding that I am able to make as good a cup of coffee at home the same as going to my local expensive coffee shop.  I am not a youngster. But I highly recommend trying this to make excellent coffee at home"
5,"NO llego completo Buen articulo, no llegaron completos"
5,"Perfect for travel, handy. Awesome bag"
5,"Great product… But does take some practice I was very skeptical about this product until my cousin introduced it to me. Being a user of tampons and pads for many years I thought that was the norm.   first thing to understand… Is that you cannot be afraid to become familiar with your lady… In order to use this product. I will say, that for me, my cervix must be located somewhere in Siberia, because it has to go along way to do the job.  there are many folds/positions that you can try in inserting the cup. A water-based lubricant can help as well. Do not be afraid to practice… Practice… Practice. Because, in this case, it does make perfect.  for me, the best position seems to be the frog position… Why are you lying on your back, and fold your legs into a diamond shape, and slowly insert the cup. Remember, you cannot leave it squished in your vagina, or it will leak.   don't be afraid to stretch your vaginal walls so that the cup  can suction to your vaginal walls  accordingly. It can't be a messy process, but once you get the hang of it. It will send you much money on tampons/pads's and you  will be grateful you purchased this product."
5,"Perfect! I bought these because since my 4 oz bottles came with this size I loved it since I began using them. But once I bought the 9oz bottles it came with flow #2. Trust me I did not like those every minute I had to be taking out the bottle from my baby’s mouth since it crunches up not allowing milk to go through. So for my 9oz bottles I bought these and and perfectly satisfied!"
5,"Great watch,works very well. A great and beautiful watch my husband loves it!!"
5,"These pants may make me quit my job Stupid comfortable. I'm not sure I can take them off to go to work, so they may be my downfall. I'm about 5'9"", and these come just above my ankles, which is their only fault. Combo with tall cushy socks and boom! Perfectly comfortably paralyzing."
5,"Love this crop top. Good quality and speedy delivery. The crop top fits as expected"
2,"Not so good this time Have ordered this previously and it was great. This time the coffee tasted good but somehow the coffee grounds are getting into the coffee and kind of spoils it. Have experimented some and have found it id only and consistently this product. Starbucks and Kirkland work fine with no grounds. I'm thinking the pod built in filter may be defective but in any case I will not be reforming this coffee item. Paul"
3,"Strangely smaller than my other Pureflow7s I recently purchase Pueflow 7 from Luke’s foot locker in black and thought they were great! But I found these in a color I like better on Amazon and for $10 less so I purchased them. Both purchases are 8.... but oddly enough , the ones from Amazon are too small. And not only that, but the sole is lifting on the inside. Last thing (which isn’t a deal breaker but makes me a little more sketchy that they’re not a fresh purchase) is that there wasn’t cardboard inserts inside of them like you get when you have new shoes.  As for the Purflow themselves, they’re alright. I’m retiring them both to get Hokas due to on and off plantar. They’re great for works outs but I don’t suggest for running shoes even though “they’re the best”."
1,"Defective and poorly designed The milk bottle was empty and the orange juice looks like hot sauce. It doesn’t look like it is being fed to the doll, it just immediately empties into the top of the bottle when tipped. Nothing like I expected"
4,"Good choice for low budget bags, but not super great on space. Bought this to go with my new 17 inch laptop.  Didn't want to spend a lot of money on a big bulky bag, so I picked this because it looked simple and I thought it would do the job well.  The bag is pretty slim, seems well made.  The laptop fits in very snugly, in fact, almost TOO much such that I have to make an effort to close the zipper around the corners of the laptop.  It could stand to be maybe 1"" inch bigger.  The other thing that's sort of an issue is that with the big laptop in there, there's not a lot of room for expansion width-wise.  I put in the power brick and a USB mouse, and things start getting tight.  There's not much room for carrying anything else in the bag without putting stress on the seams.  Overall, it's good for the price, and it's serving the purpose of protecting the computer.  If you are looking for something more heavy duty with extra space for storage or something that would stand up to a little more travel, I would not look at this bag.  This is an inexpensive cover for light duty use."
4,"Compact efficiency. Good for everyday heating, defrosting."
4,"Kinda love them I absolutely LOVE these hoops! Everything about them, except the size! They are bigger than a bracelet which is why I gave them 4 stars! But I still wear them! They are made well, they do not break my ears out, they are light weight and I always get compliments on them ... I just can’t wear them all day but I still love them and you get more than you pay for with these! One thing I may suggest: no one knows what 80mm is when it comes to hoops and I certainly didn’t expect bracelets but I will absolutely still wear these"
5,"This is legit ‼️ Their perfect. I have no problems, happy customer!"
5,"Perfect for small wrist I always wanted to buy this watch and the turtle. had a research between several seiko diver’s watch because I have a small wrist. This fits perfect on my wrist and I love it."
5,"So much better than hand washing every single bottle, cap and nipple! I didn't know you could run the bottles through the dishwasher. We have the Dr. Brown brand and I saw this when I went to order more bottles. It keeps everything off the counter, you know it got sanitized properly in a heat cycle, and it's so easy to load it once you figure out which pieces go where. I saved the cardboard picture showing where each item fits, but we've used it a few times now, and have the basket down. GREAT product!!!"

I took a picture of everything that came in the box. I love that it came with a cleaning wand, and I'm not 100% sure what the green stick is for, but I'm sure I will soon. Super easy to use, good quality, and even though the bottle seems small it is plenty. I filled the nutribullet to the ""max line"" and then emptied it into this blenders bottle. As you can see from the picture, even though it appears much larger, the ""max"" amounts are pretty similar. It crushed straight through a full bottle of ice, and made short work of my smoothie."
5,"work perfectly with my google pixel2 i'm very pleased with these headphones. the usb c port connects perfectly with my google pixel2. the build quality is top notch. sound quility is excellent both for music and talking. the earbuds fit in my ear well, it is very comfortable while sealing off outside noises. the audio is very clear, well balanced. they are capable of pumping out deep quality bass, but it is well balanced in the mix. the volume control is also conveinent for you to pause or play a song, and other functions. great design! if you are looking for a pair of usb c headphones to fit your type c enabled smartphones or tablets, these are the good choice."
5,"Light weight, Accurate, Aesthetic, Comfortable Really comfortable watch with power pack features in affordable price."
5,"Bargain watch Looks and performs like a much more expensive diver watch.  Great addition to my collection.  Very durable and looks good with everything."
5,"Keeps you warm! Girlfriend rides about 20 miles on her bike year round. She really loves this."
5,"Where has this been all my life! Fantastic The life long dilemma of finding the right sippy cup, that doesn't leak, yet is easy to hold has continued for 7 years. I have a go to now, but it does't have handles - which my month requires. This handle fits the sippy cups i have and is a life saver! Should be put on the ""Must Have"" baby and kid list for sure! Thank you Dr. Brown!"
5,"great product My friend suggested I get a personal blender instead of using my big one for single shakes and smoothies. this one is great. Easy to clean and just change from mixing lid to drinking lid. Very easy. Just be sure that the rubber ring on the mixing lid is in place or it will leak when mixing."
5,"Great product! Great product and easy to use."
5,"Great deals, you get a hundred pack at a ... Great deals, you get a hundred pack at a fantastic price. These create crystal clear laminate that are semi rigid with great durability. Love love love it. Just reordered more. Highly recommend. I use these with the Amazon laminator they make a perfect duo. Recommended to a great friend and they are ordering one today along with the packet of laminating sheets. I buy the full sheet size that still allows approximately a quarter of an inch all the way around a typical eight and a half by 11 piece of paper. You can also cut small pictures and laminate multiple ones on a sheet. This is a must buy."
5,"Easy install and long life Perfect fit for my stove lights. Install trick is to use duck tap turned inside out on the old light to help unscrew it. Worked like a champ for me."
2,"Was nice at first. I use this daily and when traveling. I liked it very much until my zipper broke and the inside stitching started falling apart."
3,"It arrived here on time but it was SOOOOO painful to use It arrived here on time but it was SOOOOO painful to use. The burning/itching sensation got 50x worst and it was the most uncomfortable thing to deal with."
1,"Black plastic shavings were found all over the base and my counter and jar would work itself loose during operation making a ter Jar and base started to grind together and locking mechanism was no longer tight. Black plastic shavings were found all over the base and my counter and jar would work itself loose during operation making a terrible noise and a dangerous situation."
1,"Ear pod kept popping off The inner ear cushion/pod kept coming off so it was basically stuck in my ear. I checked to make sure the cushion was securely placed on the device but gave up after the 3rd time. This could be hazardous if it got stuck in the ear canal. Also, the silicon piece that wraps around the ear is too big for me. not something you can adjust either."
1,"THEY CAN'T BE FROM AMAZON I know AMAZON can't be responsible for the quality of all their products  but I was so amazed when I used one of the and found it had zero absorbency!  I hate to take the time and effort to return them but other than using them for a  small leak pad they are useless."
4,"Good Works like they are supposed to."
4,"Nice kettle This kettle replaced my old one.  It does the job pretty well.  The only gripe i have with it is you have to pour really slowly because the spout is prettty small and narrow.  The second issue is the rim and spout are plastic, and im not really cool with boiling water and plastic because its been proven to leech out carcinogens.  Otherwise, it lpoks great and boils water pretty quickly."
4,"Has held up pretty well so far - 5 years Have owned for 5 years with fairly frequent hill walking use.  Altimeter appears as accurate as Garmin GPS.  Compass is adequate for any non precision use.  Generally have found the watch easy to use.  Battery seems to last 8 to 14 months with using altimeter for about 8 hours 2 - 3 times a month.  Watch strap loop broke after 3 years, purchased new generic loop for $3 via Amazon, good as new.  Did not give 5 stars due to display brightness in low light can be difficult to read,  Okay at night with the watches own light."
5,"Greatest Amazing"
5,"For the price you can't find much better. As someone who has owned a pair of SoundPeats Bluetooth wireless headphones before, I recommend these to all of my close acquaintances merely due to the exceptional build quality and fantastic value for money. A hefty 800mAh battery for the charging case provides numerous (8+) charges for the earphones, which themselves are light, comfortable, responsive, and do not easily fall out of ones ears, even my own which have a peculiar anatomy! Bluetooth connectivity is flawless, and using one earphone to chat or listen to music can be done easily and discreetly. At the current price these are an absolute STEAL, much better value than some name brand products such as AirPods or Beats. Cannot recommend enough, 11/10 all the way."
5,"The strongest super glue around! I have an almost 4 year old child whom constantly breaks and destroys items and breaks toys alike, so when it is physically possible I  like to salvage and repair the items that my son breaks. Gorilla glue is by far the best most excellent glue that I've ever used! It's so strong, and the instant hold is superior over any other glue. I can easily repair anything with gorilla glue, and it's a must have in our household. I highly recommend gorilla glue."
5,"My printer is Brother MFC-L2710DW I bought my brother printer about a year ago and use it now and again and only recently have I received the warning that the toner was low from the drum that was included with the printer. With that being said I was not happy seeing the OEM Brother drums being sold for $80 consider the printer I bought was $120 or something like that. I get ink is expensive, or at least thought of that until I started looking at third party toners. Of course I was skeptical like most everyone that buys third party and not OEM, but amazon is great for returns and to get not one, but two ink drums for $25 seemed like a no brainer. I just received the drums a few minutes ago and I already replaced and printed out about 10 pages of ""test"" pages including from some random website and then some airline tickets and everything printed perfectly. I even saw that there was a possibility of microchip issues between these third party drums and the printer so I looked up videos on how to transfer the original chip to the new drum and even purchased a tool kit to do so. Other than spending $10 on the tools, I am pleased to announce that there were zero issues with getting a microchip error. I looked on YouTube for a video on how to replace the drum and everything took less than 5 minutes from starting to printing. I highly recommend this drum as it saved me about $125. If I were to buy 2 drums of OEM ink that would be $160. It's really a no brainer to buy third party ink because they perfected the microchips and do not cause any issues when trying to print."
5,"Beautiful snd Functional Beautiful jacket and it fits perfectly!"
5,"good waterproof watch - easy to set and use - reliable I bought this watch because I wanted a simplistic watch that I could easily set that would reliably tell the time and could go to the pool or shower or wherever with me - ie is waterproof.  This watch fills the bill. It is easy to set, the large bold lettering is easy to see and read, and it seems to reliably tell the correct time. It is so much more my style than some of the other waterproof watches I have purchased in the past that had all the buttons on the side whereby you had to navigate the buttons to set the time and also whereby it seemed if I had pushed the wrong button on the side of the watch then it was doing something other than telling the current time."
5,"This bracelet is a work of art! What an awesome piece of art for such a low price! An incredibly attractive piece of jewelry, not to mention the spiritual rush while wearing it."
5,"ABSOLUTELY AMAZING!!!!!!!!! I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE these products. I also have the thong sandals as well and they are AMAZING!!! I wish I would've found these products before spending over $2,000 with my foot doctor which didn't help/fix my foot problem. I HIGHLY recommend these to anyone that has feet problems..."
5,"Great watch for the money. Really is waterproof. Wearing it almost nonstop for about 2 weeks. Went in a swimming pool every day with this watch on. The only thing to wear off was the white dots and words around the clock lens. It's recommended to not press buttons underwater, and I imagine the watch will last at least a year or two so long as you don't press buttons underwater, or the watch itself breaks open.  It's okay about the fading words because it's only labels for the buttons, which you'll learn quickly. I suggest looking at an online guide or the manual for how to setup chimes and alarms."
5,"Good socks to run in. Ran a 5K wearing these and loved them! Stayed up the entire time and were superior for the holiday run. Also kept my feet dry and warm."
5,"Impressive backpack I ordered in green and love the color. It isn’t to masculine of a color and I love it.. was nervous about that and my husband loves the color So it’s a win win. I bought this for travel for work. The usb charging port is a big plus. Can fit more than you think in it and it fits my Mac book pro in it. Love that I can have my husband carry it too bc i previously carried a pink one. Love the messenger style look to the bag too!!"
5,"Great watch for the price. This is an excellent watch, but not for everybody because is small. The G-shock series is used extensively by the military, because is extremely well built and durable, and it uses only high quality materials, It's also very light and comfortable.  Positive: +Accurate. +Battery. +Well built and Rugged. +Great watch for the price.  Negative: -Light only lights the small digital display at the bottom of the watch. -The minute hand will obscure your view when is on 25 past the hour."
5,"Works good at removing odors Works good at removing odors.  Instructions say to leave on 15 minutes and 30 minutes for set-in odors.  I found that less than 10 minutes was better; the odor gone and the perfume smell didn't linger."
2,"Very disappointing but you get what you pay for. I have bought this watch twice now and both times it has run for a little under a year before the works come loose inside the case, and maybe 90 to 180 days before the battery stopped holding any charge causing it to need reset every day or be worn 24 hours a day. The watch is very affordable which is why I bought it for my son, but it is also very cheaply made for a seiko. I have self winding Seikos that are 20+ years old and still running but this one has been very disappointing both times that I bought it. Save yourself the frustration and just spend a little more on one that is built to last longer."
3,"3 because I’m SO torn Okay, they’re super cute, and light which I love!  BUT!  they smell SOOOOOOOOO bad. Not like, a a chemical smell, but just a STINK. I’m hoping letting them air out will help, but if not I can’t wear them and be that mystery stink in a room everyone is trying to find."
3,"AVERAGE WATCH Nice watch. Good reviews. There's some difficulty telling time. The watch is bigger ( thicker ) than I'm used to, so I have had difficulty buttoning some of my shirts because of the thickness of this watch. OA, it's an  ""OK"" watch."
1,"No hole in nipple, baby couldn’t eat I’ve been buying these for years but my last batch one of them didn’t have a hole! I had no idea and my baby wasn’t eating anything. After about 9 hrs I was getting him ready to go to the hospital when I happened to check his bottle(I wish i thought of sooner but never had issues before) and it wasn’t working. I thought maybe it was clogged but nothing was working so finally I grabbed something to stab through the hole only to discover there was actually no hole at all. Literally none. Once I changed the nipple out my baby ate 3 bottles within an hour and is sleeping for the first time in hours. I was almost out a hospital bill because of this not including my poor baby was hungry. Seems really unprofessional to not quality control and ensure there are at least holes in the product. Otherwise I have never had an issue before this, probably making me too trusting and why I didn’t suspect it was the bottle to begin with sadly."
1,"Came in tarnished I bought this as a valentines gift for my wife and have recievedit tarnished and already changing color on the charm which wasn't even presentable as the gift. Sorry but I have to rate quality definitely a 1 star"
4,"Good scissors! UPDATE: I am still happy with these scissors, but I am docking one star. For the price they’re still great, and I’m generally very happy with them... but I sliced my finger open last night on the back side of the blade when I opened scissors wide to flatten a box. I’ve used other scissors like this before and the edge wasn’t so sharp. I’m honestly not surprised or even upset, they were cheap, but ouch! So watch out for shark edges, and you get what you pay for, but I’m still happy.  Original review: After using the same old pair of scissors for several years of marriage ... I realized there was no good reason for not buying new ones. These are sharp, come as a three pack, and we’ve been pleased with all  of them so far. My favorite part is having in various locations  over the house and not having to go hunt every time."
4,"No nonsense I bought this for the price mostly and am quite satisfied with the product. This was a replacement for a similarly priced Panasonic I bought eight years ago that finally croaked. It doesn't have lot of complicated features that I wouldn't pay attention to anyway. The only thing I miss is the ADD A MINUTE button but the defrost mode works very well at evenly defrosting frozen food."
5,"GREAT LOOKING and quality product GREAT LOOKING  and quality product."
5,"Strong battery and case is quite cute Its battery life is very good. The best thing is that its shows you how much battery is remaining so you can recharge it. It gives you peace of mind if you need it outdoor and doesn’t have charging option but you know how much charge your ear buds still have . Really like it. Sound quality is good and the noise canceling is excellent. Even on full volume a person sitting next to you can’t hear a thing."
5,"Great if you have double lobe piercings I purchased these because they're made out of surgical steel and I wanted some small hoops for my double lobe piercings. I actually really like how these are a bit thicker than the normal dainty hoops and the closures are very secure. I have sensitive ears and I have no problem taking these on and off. I'll probably purchase them in rose gold too - I wear the 8mm in the high lobe piercing and the 10mm in the regular lobe piercing."

It is able to accumulate many items, including books, clothes, small items in the front pockets and included bags. Able to carry all that I need for a whole day without hurting my shoulders or spine (considering how much I am carrying &amp; compared with other backpacks I have had)."
5,"It keeps the soft cup from getting dirty. I use it to store my soft cup while it is not being used. When I clean my cup I use the lid to allow the softcup to dry. Then, when all is dry,  I feel good about my soft cup staying clean and dry and not getting smashed  or shoved out of the way."
5,"Command Picture hangers They hand everything.  I have my whole place covered in family (framed) pictures, all by this product.  Just use the right size and they will stay hung until you take it off.  However, they don't stick well to wallpaper."
5,"Great purchase, great price, great material!! Bought this back pack for use during travel. It works perfect as my personal item on flights. I use the laptop compartment to hold my travel documents and still have plenty of room for clothing, snacks etc. It will also double as a beach/day trip bag while on vacation. The attached luggage strap is perfect for attaching to a carry on bag and the USB cord, which is included, is perfect for attaching to a portable battery and charging devices."
5,"Keep your kitchen well ventilated! Great for any kitchen and easy to install.  The fan is powerful and quiet!"
5,"Great adhesion! Works great! I don’t use anything else for making cards!"
5,"I was suffering terrible night sweats and heat flashes during the day 39, and recently had an ovary remove due to severe endometriosis, and then had Mirena IUD inserted for endo control. I was suffering terrible night sweats and heat flashes during the day. Those are completely gone now, thankfully, and I'm experiencing very deep sleep more nights now."
5,"Excellent product --- works exactly in the manner I had hoped for I am using this exterior tape to mount ""URPOWER Solar Lights 8 LED Wireless Waterproof Motion Sensor Outdoor Light for Patio, Deck, Yard, Garden with Motion Activated Auto On/Off (4-Pack)"". It works quite well.  Even better, when the scant amount of exterior mounting tape failed on a ""Swiftly Done Bright Solar Power Outdoor LED Light No Tools Required Peel and Stick Motion Activated"", I used a more reasonable amount of this Scotch product to re-affix the ""Swiftly (un)Done"" solar lamp in a much secure fashion than the original tape."
2,"Color was off, camel toe, size is off. They feel comfortable but, the color was more gold then a camel color and I ordered a large I’m between a 14-16 and I had to keep pulling them up all day.  If I were to buy again I would get a medium. And, camel 🐪 toe  I also bought the Coffee color wanting a dark brown and their more of a red brick brown not coffee color at all! In the sun you can see more of the red threading and the second picture they appear more brown when in fact the color isn’t a true brown you notice right away they are not dark brown."

Afraid to wear it. It is so then. It say a solid rope it donot even look like a rope bcause it us so thin!!!!!!! I'm not happy at all.. 😣"
1,"Completely surprised- Updated my review UPDATE:  I’m adjusting my rating. I bought these shoes 2 months ago and I’ve had nothing but back issues. It was until today I realized this 100%. I made the mistake a few times of standing all day in these shoes. I ended up very sore and lower back pain. Just last week I did the same and now I have what feels to be a pinched nerve on my right side. I wore the shoes today knowing I wouldn’t be on my feet much and that nerve caused me so much pain. Immediately after I removed the shoes When I got home I felt relief. Unfortunately this means I have to throw away these shoes. I’m really bummed. The heels are too much of an incline and the shoes themselves provide zero support. I have NO idea how some of these reviews say they are so comfortable they can be in them all day. I couldn’t even casually go walking at a slow pace in them at lunchtime without developing blisters on the balls of my feet.  They just don’t work for me.  Shame it’s such a waste of money that I wish I could get back. ———————————————————-  These shoes are awesome.  As soon as I got them I had to try them on.  There were foam inserts to prevent the shoes tow from getting mashed.  They can with little footies to try on the shoe.  I bought a size 8 and I normally buy a 7.5-8 shoe depending on the brand.  Without socks, these were loose and slippery.  I put on a pair I always wear and perfect fit.  They are super comfy without socks but I'm one of those people that can't wear anything on my feet without socks.  My feet don't feel restricted and I have a good range of movement.  These will not support ankles.  I feel that if these were to get wet, the tops would dry faster than normal shoes.  I don't know about the soles.  Walking it feels squishy like a cloud.  Its nice. I will be purchasing additional ones in other colors."
1,"Fed up with this bottle leaking I tried many things to preserve the life of these bottle lids. The lids broke very soon after I received them. Many after 2 or 3 uses and washing by hand. I still try to use them because I like the bottle but it leaks everywhere now. Now I just see it as a total waste of money. I don't understand how people have avoided this happening. If I could buy new lids, I'd try using them again but I don't think that's possible so they're going in the recycling."

4,"Rugged GLAM-Pack...A Little Form Over Function Never Hurt Anybody. It's a big pack.  Given it's outer dimensions, seems like it should hold more than it actually does.  Reason: All the extra bling and doo-dads &amp; stuff.  The fancy hardware, goggles holder/bonnet, and pressure molded back panel greatly diminish the amount of usable interior space.  Also, most other packs are replete with an assortment of various compartments.  Oakley's design favors a large, cavernous bag with a minimal number of satellite storage spaces.  The Kitchen Sink is more of a weekender/tool bag - very durable with large, defined storage spaces.  Unlike a PC backpack, the Kitchen Sink does not have layers of zippered and mesh compartments, ports for device wires, more than two pen holders, water bottle or key-ring holders, or ANY kind of quick access space.  Moving from a pc bag to this might leave you underwhelmed. That being said:  It's still a GREAT bag! It's still a big bag too. Although slightly less than you'd think, it still has a huge storage capacity.  The space-hogging, back panel and interior padding give my 15"" laptop absolute protection.  Materials and manufacture are first rate.  Zippers, pulls, rings and other hardware appear to be quite durable and well-secured.  Zippered floor panel and interior storage liner keep shoes separate from main compartment.  (I do miss the floor vents and zipper-pull snap from the previous model)  This bag is extremely comfortable with or without the padded waist strap.  It is very well balanced when worn over both shoulders or just one.  It's a great looking bag. The unique design is very compelling.  I went with the stealth black over the flash of the chrome. If you just want a gym bag, go with the Bathroom Sink.  If you want college student / pc bag, this ins't it.  If you need a weekend bag or a tool pack that also safely stores a laptop, the Kitchen Sink will delight you."
4,"Great Watch, Almost Perfect This is a great watch and the price is hard to beat. I own many fine collector timepieces but this is the  watch I wear every day.  Good looking military style face and very good water resistance. Like many other reviewers I immediately throw away the watchband that comes stock and replace it with a NATO style band or my current favorite, a black Perlon band. This is my second BM8180. I broke the crystal on my first one kayaking which brings me to the quibble that keeps me from giving the watch five stars. On this watch the second hand does not align perfectly with the second markers on the dial. On my old watch it did. Since the second hand is off the mark differently as it travels around the dial I can only conclude that the problem is in the printing of the face. This isn't a deal breaker for me but I do find it slightly annoying. But lets face it, this watch costs less than a hundred bucks. I don't expect it to be a Rolex."

5,"Nice blender Light weight and easy to use"
5,"Tremendous value for the money! Fantastic value, and found that they can be cut to different shapes, which gives them versatility.  Size is kind of large for me, but have made smaller teardrop, circles and long rectangular drop from them.  Will be buying again."
5,"Happy hubby hubby loves it, doesn’t even want to wear it, 😁😁 , as long as he’s happy so am i , thanks amazon"
5,"Great product &amp; customer support Pros: 3 sizes of blenders to blend a mix of things. Top notch customer support:  Notes: I haven't used it much but it does blend well.  Their customer support is as high as you can get.  I lost the blade for the largest container so I contacted them in hopes to purchase a new blade separately. They responded that because they don't sell any part separately I could get a whole new complete set for free! I sent them my address and they really did send me a complete second set with all 3 blenders and the original packaging for me for free which arrived only days later! I've never have had support like that before!"
5,"Great Backpack, Great Price I already owned one of these backpacks (for about 4 months) and used it recently on a business trip.  Love all the organization features.  It is comfortable to wear and has lot of room.  I only gave 3 stars on durability because I've not had it long enough to attest to how long it will last but it is very sturdy, well designed and all the seams and zippers seem to be well reinforced.  Purchased a second one for my son to take away to school - that will be the true test!  Thanks for a great product and we will look at these first when we are in the market for another laptop backpack."
5,"Like this bag Lightweight, lots of pockets, and easy to clean. I did break one of the zippers straight away but other than that very happy with it."
5,"Individually wrapped I like that these are individually wrapped and that they stick to your underwear very well."
5,"Very pretty earrings My husband bought these for me as a Christmas gift and I am very happy with them.  They are slightly larger than I expected but not too big.  They have a nice sparkle.  While they are one of the heavier pairs of earrings I own they are still comfortable and I really enjoy them."
5,"First Pair A coworker of mine suggested I try these shoes, as we are on our feet several hours a day. These are truly some of the most comfortable shoes I've ever worn. They are well worth the moderately salty price."
5,"Bought this for my Brother HL-L2350DW Bought this for my Brother HL-L2350DW, easy instructions, installed without any issue and printed perfect right away!  I have two of these printers (home and office) and the two pack is great!  Will be buying again for sure!  NOTE:  Bought both printers pre June 2018 .... I know some people faced problems with newer models I think."
5,"Fits perfectly for my needs. Finally got the ""perfect"" sling bag as my daily carry-on.  I used to bring along a traditional backpack - even though it wasn't that big, it was still too big for the stuff I usually haul with me.  This one is not too big, and not too small.  It can carry everything that I need on-hand: my medications (Asthma inhaler, heart medication), hearing aid case (and back up batteries), phone, 2DS XL, sunglasses, chargers (plugs, cables, etc), and a few pens.  The fact that the strap is able to be adjusted for lefties and righties is a very big plus for me!  Can be worn casually or semi-casually - meaning this isn't too out of place with office-wear either."
5,"Everyone LOVED it! I purchased this over a year ago for a trip overseas, along with another for comparison, and decided to travel with the heavier well padded cross body one (it worked well).  Then I went on a school field trip a few months ago and decided to take THIS one rather than a purse.  I put my car keys, wallet, camera, cell phone, snacks, water bottle and even a jacket in it!  I could not have put that much in the other one.  I like it SO much, that I purchased them in different colors for my three adult siblings for an outdoors trip we took recently. They all loved them!  Then I took mine on a two week trip to Hawaii, using it for my day pack every day.  It has so many features and many pockets. When I came home, I just folded it into a small pack as shown in the instructions provided.  I would not use it for a regular backpack, to carry big books or a laptop, or instead of a suitcase.  But  I've carried a book, a tablet, multiple items like make up, snacks,  sunglasses, and even my hiking stick.  It can hold a LOT of items, the colors are beautiful, and anything that spilled on it wiped right off.  You can organize your items too, because it has so many pockets.  Finally, the price is so affordable so I highly recommend this product."

3,"Not the size I was expecting I have these Kate Spade earrings and bought this pair for my friend. Based on the description, Small Stud Earrings, I thought they would be the same size as mine. They aren't. They are significantly bigger, which makes me wonder if these are a knock off and not the real deal. I have multiple pairs of Kate Spade studs and they are all the same size. I still love the earrings but I'm very disappointed in the size. I may be returning them, as my friend is also very familiar with Kate Spade and these aren't usual. :("

1,"Doesn't stand behind product-inferior workmanship I have 2 pairs of these headphones.  First one lasted about 16 months and then would not charge anymore.  This seemed like the normal life span I had experienced with most headphones so I bought another pair.  Within 6 months one of the buds popped out of place (see pic) while lifting at the gym.  Contacted customer service and their reply was they do not warranty physical damage.  They offered me a whopping 5% discount towards another pair....$1.35.  Ridiculous.  This failure was clearly a result or poor production.  I guess they don't expect you to wear them in your ears as it could cause damage.  Am now using Mpow set. They are less expensive, and so far have actually had better connectivity.  Do not waste your money on this Senso product."
4,"Comfy and absorbent....but won't win any style prizes I bought this not for ""sports"", but for gardening.  I work up a pretty good sweat, and my normal underwires got soaked.  The cotton fabric on these is comfy, stretches with me, and is very absorbent.  There is not enough support to go jogging (I am a DD), but they do the job I need them to do.  That being said, I appreciate the reviews that recommended going up a size.  Worked great!"

5,"fantastic watch. very beautiful fantastic watch. very beautiful. Everyone looks at its beauty when I wear it on. The gold shampaigne color is awsome. I think it keeps you a little bit sweaty in hot days,but you can wear it in winter,spring,autumn. The battery is solar energy,so till now (1 year I have had it) it has worked fine."
5,"Best Looking Analog Gshock! ! Best Looking Abalog gshock. I got this watch in the mail today. The watch is big but fits very comfortable on wrist. I have about 7 inch wrist size. Great looking gshock looks better in person, than in picture. I have  something important to tell everyone. I set the watch everything  was perfect. The  watch was medium on the battery. No big deal set it in the Sun light for about a hour. The battery read High everything was  perfect. So I put the watch on starting cycling thru the modes everything worked. Than l hit the mode button again, and the hands stopped and the digital part was perfect time. So l called Casio they didn't know  what was wrong. I thought I got a bad watch and was hoping l didn't have to send it. So l called the gshock Store in New York. He told me to hold the  mode button down for 3 seconds everything works perfect. So if it ever happened to you you will know what to do.I been wearing gshocks for 33 years. I now have 18 gshocks and 3 Protreks. That man was very helpful. I love this watch. I'm  so glad that everything works great. I f you ever have a problem call the Gshock Store in New York City great guy very helpful. I had the first gshock to hit the market in 1983. Just when you think you no it all there is something else you learn.Thanks to the very friendly Gentileman. He knew more than the Casio Support Center. Boy this watch is great, Buy it you will Love it."
5,"Great watch, great value All the quality I expect from Bulova. Very beautiful display face, and a perfect blue color...this watch looks sharp! The day of the week display is a nice added feature. The box it came in was extremely high quality as well."
5,"Loved it Pretty"
5,"Highly recommended Comfortable and flexable.  I work as a nurse and only wear ASICS.  When I went to my foot Dr due to swelling in one foot (turned out to be arthritis from a broken foot when I was a teenager) he highly recommended ASICS.  Many of my coworkers wear them.  12-16 hr shifts on your feet are definitely no fun but my feet feel great with these shoes and I’m near 60 and have worked as a nurse for 30 years.  I will continue to buy them and recommend them."
5,"Pricy... but totally worth it. I mean, it feels silly to be so stoked about socks (because they’re... socks) but these are seriously by far the best socks i’ve used for athletic training by a LONG SHOT. I was initially weary about the price but all of the “big brand name” socks were causing me issues (slipping while running; wearing thin in midsole/toes; shifting so much they would cause discomfort during long long runs [10+ miles] and result in numb toes) and after having used these for a solid month now, I can confidently say that these socks blow those out of the water. Absolutely worth the price point! Love them so much I bought 6 pairs."
5,"So far so good when travel feeding with baby! We had to switch up to a Holle Formula (from Germany) &amp; it requires to be heated before consuming so we had to search for something that we can easily feed our little one while on the go.  This was amazing &amp; the price was great that we ordered 2!  This thermos heats &amp; last for almost the whole day.  I know some were saying that theirs leak and at first we thought ours did too, but after reading the instructions and figured out that once you tip the thermos to use, push the middle button on the top to make it pop up so that it locks, but tip it again to get the extra access water that got trapped at the top when you first poured and your leak problem is no more (hope this helps if that is the only leak issue you had).  So far, we have not encountered anything else, but will update if we do."
5,"Dainty Fits great. Love the look and size. Its a perfect dainty choker"
2,"Unfortunately didn't work for me I wanted to really enjoy this product - I have a set of the Soundcore noise cancelling headphones, which I absolutely love. But this product just didn't really live up to my expectations for the product. The cardinal sin was that the audio from the headphones just kept randomly dropping for no apparent reason. It dropped while I was sitting in my bedroom with no other interference, it dropped while I was walking through the airport, it dropped while mowing the lawn. Now the drops were not for long periods of time (maybe 1-2 seconds) but it kept happening with no apparent reason that it got very annoying.  The other issue that these headphones had is that they would get out of sync with the audio from each other and also from the device they were connected to. So, when they unsynced from each other - it was basically like hearing an echo in my ears. And then whey they would unsync from the device, I could see the mouth of the actor moving but the audio coming to to me was a few seconds behind that. I've had multiple bluetooth headphones and none have done that before.  The things I did like about the product were the design, the compact nature - the semi noise cancelling when the product is in your ear. But those goods could not outweigh the constant disconnects and unsynchronization. And that's truly unfortunate."

4,"Ok so far Only used 2X b4 this review but like it. Easy to maneuver, good suction. Will follow up if any issues....mostly in regard to bad reviews that were left on this."
4,"Easily torn Okay. I keep relaxing them because I like the soft spouts vs hard spots but my son chews the spout a little and it tears open so easily within a few days.. then they have a huge hole so everything spills out."
4,"Warm and soft - order a size down. They are comfortable and warm. However, I fear these might stretch out more than I'd like. I just got them, and after only an hour of wear, they feel a bit loose. I normally wear a Medium, and I ordered a Small, and I still think they will become baggy especially in the knee area. I will keep them and wear them under ski pants, but probably not be able to wear them as leggings with a snow skirt. I am 5'2"" and 130."

5,"Love this backpack Love this backpack.  I have a 17.3"" ASUS ROG gaming laptop that I put in the AmazonBasics neoprene sleeve first then put into this backpack.  The fit is a little tight zipping it up but still works well and I like the added protection of the neoprene sleeve.  Even with the laptop in this thing has multiple useful pockets.  I am able to put the power cord, mouse, a bunch of pens, a 10"" tablet, my eye glasses case, a hard cigar case and my daily carry HK USP .45 compact and still have plenty of room for other things.  The straps are comfortable and the adjustments work very well.  There's not one thing I can think of that I do not like about this backpack.  EDITED:  I had swapped this laptop I had (ASUS ROG GL752VW-DH74 17-Inch Gaming Laptop) for the higher end model with the GTX980 video card (ASUS ROG G751JY-WH71(WX) 17-Inch Gaming Laptop) which has that cool looking air ventilation system on the back and has a wider profile which still fit in this backpack, but was very tight.  I did not want to switch this laptop bag but needed to get a bigger bag and went with the Bonvince 18.4"" Laptop Backpack Fits Up To 18.4 which is also awesome and very similar to this Amazon bag with even a few more features."

5,"AMAZING Microwave for the $$$ I'm used to using a REALLY cheap, small microwave, so when it finally bit the big one, I did a lot of research on Amazon.  I was actually looking for a combo micro/convection oven, but talked myself into the fact that I really don't need a convection oven.  So when I found this one for under $80, and saw that it included a broiler (really??), I jumped on it.  Actually, I read LOTS of reviews on it first, and although there are several negative ones, I decided to give it a try.  SO glad I did!  I'm still getting used to the amount of power this thing has, but I love it!  I haven't had any problems getting to know the settings, and I'm kinda old ; )  The controls are a little hard to read if your kitchen isn't brightly lit ... but not so bad that I can't figure it out.  I have only used the broiler once, and that was to cook some frozen mini eggrolls.  It was pretty cool ... I used the broiler/microwave combo option so they cooked inside and got some color on the outside.  Not quite as good as deep frying, but an OK option.  I probably won't use the broiler for burgers, steaks, chicken, or anything else that will splatter, as I don't want the cleanup.  Still don't understand how the metal rack can be used with the broiler/microwave combo setting without blowing the thing up, but it works!  I wish the instruction book had more info and ideas on the broiler, but I do love to experiment.  This came really well packed, but still came with a small dent in the upper right side.  Just cosmetic, not too noticable, and does not affect the operation.  I know I could have returned it to Amazon, but it's not worth my time."
5,"everyone loves this bag i used to see all my asian friends carrying around geometric shaped purses and bags similar to this one. i got so excited when i saw it was becoming a thing around where i live (in GA)  i get compliments  everywhere i go with this bag. and its perfect for traveling. it holds ALOT. good price for what you get!"

5,"Watch is Great! I will begin by telling you what I like in a watch.  Atomic time, solar, dual time and some kind of animation on the home screen or some other way to show the seconds ticking other then the normal way you see the numbers increase. I also look for Auto EL, NOT a thick or too big of a watch, Dual Time and the display of the time can't be too small. These are the things that I look for in a watch and is what I have found in this watch!  The watch was not on High charge when I got it.  I left it out every now and then for about an hour or two for a few days and it went to High.  IT WILL GO TO HIGH.  It never left High since.  Just don't think about it and just wear it.  The ""RCVD"" could be a lot bigger to read but it is not a game changer for me since it receives the signal every night on my wrist.  I live on Long Island NY.  I keep it on my wrist for two reasons.  I have trouble sleeping at night (drinking too much water at night) and when the watch receives the signal than I know that I was sleeping well and wasn't moving my wrist around.  The second reason is I love radios and it's great knowing that I can DX while I'm sleeping.  Dual Time displays on the same screen.  I hope this helps some of you out there that are thinking about this watch.  Price and shipping was great also. Thanks."
5,"Quality Product &amp; Reasonable Price I read and trust user reviews I see on Amazon.  We have been ordering MFLABEL Half Sheet Self Adhesive Shipping Labels for Laser and Inkjet Printers for years.  Occasionally the labels we receive are a tad thicker or thinner than the previous order and I've reported that on earlier reviews.  For the past year, the thickness of the label and backing has been consistent at 0.005"" and the backing alone has been 0.002"".  We use HP Laserjet printers and these labels feed and print fine.  I had one jam about three years ago when I received a shipment of thinner labels.  It happened when I ran one label and immediately reran the label stock to print the second label.  The first label came unstuck from the backing and made a real train wreck inside the printer.  It's never happened again and I believe it was thinner label stock that caused the problem.  Now I run the first label, use it, cut the used portion of the backing sheet off and use the remaining label, effectively as 8.5 x 5.5 label stock.  For me, that's not just a precaution, I've found it to be it's actually faster than using both labels on a sheet in a single pass.  We use the MFLABELS on poly envelopes, paper envelopes, cardboard boxes, and over packing tape.  The adhesion has been excellent.  In fact, we've found that on poly and over tape these labels cannot be peeled off so we've learned they need to hit the package straight because they can't be removed or repositioned without destroying them.  On paper and cardboard, if a label is peeled off it takes cardboard or paper off with it.  We've shipped thousands of packages using this label stock and we have never had a report of a label coming off of a package.  They're tough.  Using the Laserjets we get a sharp clear label and have never had a report from a shipper of the label barcode being unreadable.  Of course, the printed label is not waterproof.  Doesn't claim to be.  If that's a concern, cover the label with clear shipping tape or use a shipping envelope.  These labels arrived in shrink-wrapped cardboard boxes of 1000 labels.  Inside the shrink wrap is another cardboard box and the labels are in another shrink-wrap package of 200.  The cardboard box protects the edges from getting bent and the double shrink-wrapping protects from moisture penetration.  Great attention to detail with the packing, excellent label adhesion, sharp, black print.  I am pleasantly amazed that such a quality product can be shipped 1/2 way around the world and sold at this very reasonable price.  If I've missed anything here you need to know just let me know and I'll get back to you."
5,"It is the perfect size for guys with smaller wrists It is the perfect size for guys with smaller wrists; I've always liked the look of divers but they are generally way to big for me to pull off. I bought this just to have a nicer watch to wear hiking and to the beach, but it has become my daily watch. I have gotten many complements on the watch and people assume it is much more expensive (I only paid $45 for mine).

2,"Difficult for an amateur to install the cleats This was to be my first pair of spinning shoes with SPD cleats. I was initially going to return them because they were rubbing over the top of my foot, but I got some socks with a different profile and the rubbing stopped. I thought about canceling my return, then tried to install the cleats. The parts pouch comes with way more parts than the instructions depict. I'm not sure if it's for Look Delta cleat installation also, but the pouch was labeled SPD and that's what I bought. Mystified, I turned to youtube to try to figure it out. I decided the extra parts were just extra and put one on. Crooked. Couldn't really figure out which holes to use or what the proper position is for them. So I'm just going to return these and buy spinning shoes from a local bike shop that can help me. These were too much hassle."

3,"Stem Failure After purchasing the watch and removing it from the overly complicated packaging I carefully nudged the stem out to set the time and date. The stem came lose and pulled out completely. Pushed it back in, set the time and didn't bother with the date since it's too small to read anyway. So far it has stayed in the watch but I'll wait for the one year warranty to see if it holds. Have to have a leather band and they usually fail and are impossible to replace long before the battery goes dead."
1,"Serious Buyers Remorse - Day/Date/Time Feature Sucks! Bought this for the husband.  I'd rather have teeth pulled than try to adjust the day, date, and time on this watch.

By problem solving with brother, had a problem with toner as Brother indicated via phone call.  Amazon says a one time exception when I am a prime member and have A to Z guarrantee and that doesn't make sense.  I just want people to know what is being said to PRIME MEMBERS."
4,"2TB Extreme Portable External SSD Updated: I purchased 2 units on 8/29/19; placed both into service after formatting for macOS - 1 SSD for cloning formatted APFS &amp; 1 SSD formatted HFS+ for Time Machine backups. (I'm connecting to my MBP 15 i7 - 2016 - which has TB3 ports &amp; I'm using TB3 (.5m) cables.) Amazing how small these SSDs are &amp; to think they hold about 2TB! I like these SSDs; and, they are fast.  Ok, here's some initial observation... While these SSDs work very well, I was surprised how hot they can become during extensive read / write tasks (emphasize, extensive - meaning task runs longer than 10 - 20 minutes). Added Note: If task is short duration, 2 - 5 minutes, SSD does not get hot - may get warm, but not hot. However if SSD remains connected, albeit dismounted, for an extended time, the SSD slowly heats up to eventually, be hot. I intended keeping these SSDs continually connected for convenience, but dismounted when not in use. However after extensive tasks and SSD got hot, the SSD didn't really cool down, even when dismounted but remaining connected. ...So I will be dismounting &amp; disconnecting after completing extensive tasks, particularly for Time Machine which if set to Auto, would initiate a backup once an hour, causing SSD to tend towards hot. [My concern is that extensive use, causing SSD to be hot for extended periods, would diminish longterm reliability and lifespan.] ...When the SSD is disconnected, it cools down very, very quickly. I think it's fair to characterize I'm not using these SSDs as design intended (meaning, short-period connection &amp; task), as these SSDs are intended for convenient, mobile backup of photos, videos, etc. and won't be connected (and used) for extended periods. I do recommend; but one must be aware about SSDs heating up. Nonetheless for 2TB of SSD space, this SanDisk model is a good value ...but, time will tell about longevity."

5,"Great Toodler still likes to take a bottle of milk at night bought these since the  opening was wide and he could drink without having to force it out (I could see that with the others he was forcing it and was out of breath) now he takes is milk happily. I have no intentions of putting cereal in the bottle I did not bought it for that purpose"
5,"Good sounding earbuds The earbuds are nice and slim. I would say they are portable and have an solid design. The battery case does provide good protection to the earbuds. The battery life is excellent. I was able to watch roughly 2 movies without having to recharge. Both earbuds recharge quickly. In addition, the screen foes provide an good way to track battery life which I really like. I was also able to charge my iPad to 100% using the battery bank that is built in. I will keep this review updated in case something changes."
5,"I’m a Lululemon Align snob, and these are pretty similar, but not identical Gorgeous leggings and they feel fantastic! I’m a Leggings snob. I own 8 pairs of Lululemon Align pants....and these are a very similar legging. The fabric is more silky and less buttery feeling, but it’s still great. But honestly, they still feel freaking fantastic!!! In fact, I won’t ever run or do cardio in my lulu aligns since the fabric is so delicate....but I won’t hesitate to run in these! They actually hold up. That’s a plus! In addition, they cost less than 1/4 the price of my $98 Lulu pants, so if they for some reason get worn out from running, I can just buy more at that cheap price.  They fit amazing. I’m wearing an XS. I wear lulu size 2.  Buy them!"
5,"Real Adidas These are the real deal adidas sneakers. They fit perfectly and I love how they feel during a run, honestly the best running shoes I have ever had. I only run a few miles at a time but they are great."
5,"Great price , fast shipping These are much cheaper than in the local stores and it’s the same great product"
5,"Awesome, Versatile Dress!! This dress is AWESOME for $10. I expected it to be poorly made or cheap material for the price but it's really well made and the material is perfect and very comfortable! I ordered black and I am excited to dress it up with belts, scarves, necklaces, etc. As far as fit: I am 5'6"" 135lbs and ordered a small, and I am happy with it. It is a little short (it hits a couple of inches above my knee), the sleeves are tight but not too tight for me, and it's very loose so if you prefer fitted dresses I'd just recommend adding a belt. I would recommend this and plan to buy it in other colors!"
5,"GREAT &amp; Worth it!! Worked for me!! After battling BV for months and taking several rounds of antibiotics with no success, these suppositories worked. I may have went overboard bc I used them 2x day for 7 days. It did take the complete 7 days to clear all symptoms but I’m symptom free!! I still use them 1-2x week for maintenance (mostly bc I’m scared BV will return) I say..... Buy them! They are definitely worth it!"
5,"A good-looking watch for the office and travel I bought this watch as something I could wear to business and formal functions to try to toe the line between dressy and functional. It accomplishes this mission pretty well, though the watch is on the large side for my 6"" wrist -- making it stand out a little more than I would like. It also feels very well-built and sturdy despite being fairly light; I expect to have this watch be one of my mainstays for many years to come."
5,"Great earrings What a wonderful set of earrings. I’ve been useing for our advent calendar  My daughter is thrilled.  Great purchase"
5,"Five Stars i like this watch a lot. it looks great and is not to heavy"
5,"Soft Bristle Brush - Great for Water Bottle I love this - I use it for my kids' water bottle. The bristles are soft and it seems to get all the slimy yucky water slime even if my kids forget their water in the car for a few days."
5,"Great value for the price! I love that there's 9 of them &amp; they're all pretty much bigger than an iPhone XS which is fantastic. These are extremely soft and definitely clean my phone well."
2,"TOO BIG The only one I can use is the one that ties and the texture of them isnt very good"
3,"Bleeds through quality paper These pens are good. The ink is dark and the different tip sizes come in handy for journaling. I, however, have a MAJOR issue with the amount of ink that comes out when writing. I have a journal with thick pages meant specifically to avoid color bleed onto the back of the page. These pens still bled through (faintly) to the other side. I also would not recommend to left-handed people as the ink dries incredibly slowly. See above ""Description"" in the photo for the faint bleed through"
1,"Stops working on day 1 It stopped working on day 1. This is a bad quality product and I cannot return it since I didn't try to use it until after the return window. This is ridiculous and I want my money back. They either sent me a defective unit or this product is easy to stop working. I ready many other reviews that this happened to others. $60 just thrown away :(."
1,"Luck of the draw We can set our clocks by this microwave's failures.  Every six months the oven blows it's internal fuse.  The first two times the GE technician replaced the latch board and all the safety switches attached to the latch.  The second time same repair plus new door 1 week before warranty expiration.  After a call to Consumer Relations GE agreed to extend warranty 1 year.  Six months later another blown internal fuse (the fuse is a $48.40 part).  GE technician replaces the fuse and does no other work to diagnose why fuse blew.  Instead he argued with me about how fuses blow all the time for no reason.  You guessed it, one week later fuse blew and I am waiting for my next service appointment.  After reading the reviews here I conclude this product is either great or horrible.  If you want to roll the dice--go for it.  I'm pretty sure even the 5 stars aren't going to last 10 years like my last microwave (which was not a Chinese microwave).  I used to love GE but they are not the same GE I grew up with.  I also bought a GE washing machine--another 1 star."
4,"Good quality Exactly as advertised.  Fits range hood perfectly.  Looks rather nice.  It seems to be of good quality and nice appearance."
4,"Coffee is Subjective Dunkin is the taste of Boston, be it coffee or the actual donuts. I’ve gotten to like the taste of this coffee and even experimented with the dark roast alternative. But the original has something, like my more local French Market Coffee has something. It’s a bit pricey but I like the stuff."
5,"Five Stars Another winner from Casio."
5,"Baby gear sanitizer from heaven! Safe, easy, and convenient! Is there anything else you need? While we reserve the steam bags for trips, this provides great sanitizing for as many times as you want! It saves money over the steam bags and sized for most microwaves!"
5,"Great backpack. Got I while it was on sale and it’s everything I though it would be.  Food for high school or college students."
5,"Super comfortable 19’s are so bouncy and comfy! Love the color combo and so lightweight. I got it discounted while it still sells for full price everywhere! Great value!"
5,"Great price, great design! After a long search and spending a lot of money for wireless earbuds I think I finally found earbuds that are comfortable and has a very beautiful sound quality as well.  I watched last season of Game of Thrones on my phone with these earbuds and I was blown away by the sound. Bass is incredible. Specially during intense and action packed war scenes. I literally felt like sitting in the theatre because of the amazing sound.  Earbuds are incredibly conformable and touch buttons work very well. It takes a little bit of time remember which touch works for which action. I mostly use for pause and play. Phone call quality is really good as well.  Well recommended product for the great price."
5,"What I like about it is that I don't have to fill ... I run this on a GoalZero Lithium 1400 solar battery. It consumes about 900 watts when running (not the advertised 600). It consumes the same amount of power despite the mode (hi, med, low).  I used this in a solar-powered van conversion and it really helps with my traveling. From the ability to heat up leftovers to quickly making frozen burritos to softening potatoes, I use this thing more than my propane stove. What I like about it is that I don't have to fill up my propane when using it. I just use it for a couple minutes a day, and my solar panels restore the battery for tomorrow. Even if it runs for 10-15 minutes in a day it barely puts a dent in my solar capacity."
5,"The ultimate electronic travel bag Oh wow I love this bag.  I use it for work travel around the world with all my electronics.  15"" macbook pro, 2 ipads, kindle, tons of wires and chargers, GoPro, magazines, pens, flashlight, earplugs, more chargers, adapters, and room for food and a garment.  Love it. Best thing is you can unhook the backpack straps from the bottom, feed them thru the rollerboard handle pass thru strap, and reconnect them to the connectors, so it doesnt look like a backpack.  More professional. Velcro straps hold the computers and iPads secure, so when you open it and lay it flat on the security belts, everything is secure.  TSA is happy with it.  No computer removal.  And the laptop area is surrounded by soft corners for your computer. The sunglass case on top is hard core, so glasses are safe, And I love the orange interior!  It makes it so easy to see your things in dim light. This bag holds a ton and it's built to last.  Highly recommend.  And it holds more than the ThinkTank 2nd brain."
5,"no comments..just perfect.. Amazing watch.."
5,"New Love I love these leggings. Bought them for a yoga class and they fit great and gave me that extra ummmph in the back. Stayed in place the whole class and sweat stains were not a factor. I am 5'7 and 142lbs bought a medium. Will definitely buy more colors!!!"
5,"Five Stars Good for my daughter"
5,"Excelente Excelente"
5,"I like them! Cute, comfy, nice price."
5,"Cute but fabric is clingy I love the color but the fabric is very clingy! I gave it three stars at first but the seller reached out to me and was very extremely helpful so I’ve updated my review. Excellent customer service.  Pro tip: I prefer to layer this shirt over other tanks. I’ll order from mippo again for sure, but I’ll probably size up! 😊"
2,"Very artificial tasting The blurb did not make clear that this was artificially flavored. When it said caramel notes I thought it was describing the naturally occurring flavor in the coffee.  And for an artificially flavored coffee this is very artificial tasting. It’s very difficult to drink because the flavor is so strong and unpleasant."
3,"Big bag, bad zipper This bag is big.  I tried, and returned, many bags that were much more expensive that simply were not big enough.  It has many zippered pockets in thoughtful locations.  It is a comfortable laptop bag.  One complaint is that one of the zippers was horrible right out of the bag. The very first time I unzipped it and then rezipped it the teeth were out sync and the zipper moved past them without zipping them, leaving the pocket open.  If I go back and forth over it multiple times it will eventually close.  Because I needed this bag badly at the time, I couldn't wait on a return/replacement and have just been using it. It continue to go out of sync and not close about 1 out of every 3 attempts and then if I wrestle with it it will close again.  I am sure it will eventually fail.  Because of this, I out rarely put things in that pocket.  This is the small upper pocket on the front of the bag, not a main compartment.  The rest of the zippers seem fine.  I think it's a decent bag, and incredibly affordable, but it seems as you are taking a risk with zippers because I am not the first to report this.  If you have time to return/replace in case the bag is defective it is certainly worth the risk."
3,"Okay but not great This is my second purchase from this company, and I am not sure I’ll order anymore. It seems like their waistbands are not forgiving at all if you have any kind of a stomach. The first purchase was a pair of running leggings that had a traditional - and uncomfortable - elastic waistband. On this skirt, there’s a seam that’s visually wide at the top, but in reality, there’s a cord inside the seam that’s about 1/4 inch thick and a bit too tight for my preference. In addition, the skirt is just a bit too long. I’d like it better if it were about 2 inches shorter. I don’t want to feel it when I’m running.  The material is fairly light and thin, so it should be good on hot days. It also has a pocket built into the side of the shorts, which I will give credit for. And there’s another one in the waistband area. I’d prefer one of them to be a zipper pocket, but I’ve never actually lost anything from one of the waist pockets."
1,"Brand Sizing is Inconsistent I bought about five of these sports skirts. All of them were 2X and all of them fit differently. Very strange. This particular pattern was at least one size too small, even though another fit loosely."
1,"Very Disappointed!!!! My teenage daughter loves Adidas and we have always purchased their products. She has had one of these book bags before and it was made much better. Her last one we have had for four years and it is still in usable condition.  So because we had such great luck with this book bag we decided to buy another one. This one here we purchased was suppose to be just like it, just an updated model. My daughter has been using this book bag a little over a month now and it is falling apart. The strap is about to completely separate from the rest of the bag as show in the photos. The construction of this bag is not made well at all. I would not recommend this book bag for anyone that is past the fourth grade and has to carry large amount of weight in the bag.  Other than it falling apart the coloring is very nice and is unisex."
4,"4+ stars Cute and trendy.  Worthy of gifting to and from teens."
4,"You'll save enough that you can take your date to DQ for a Blizzard shake. So you want a simple watch at a simple price point.  You've gone online and looked at: Leonard &amp; Church, Daniel Wellington, Brathwait, MVMT and maybe a few others.  You see you can pay a price point as low as $100 and cont' on up to over $300 ++.  I did buy one of the previous mentioned watches, it was a handsome watch for sure, but it screams ""I look pretty and I'm on a website full of beautiful people, I must make you feel you are worth it!""..... Ok, let's get real, if I could justify redistributing my wealth, I'd buy at a minimum the Rolex Cellini or something even more exclusive.  But because I'm just like the average joe who realizes they need a grown up dress watch, I don't need to ""Show My Class, Like an Ass"".  So here I'm at my favorite retailer, AMAZON and I'm doing the 'filter' thing and I come across this Bulova watch.... Didn't my grandfather have great pride in his ""Accutron"" watch by Bulova back in 1963 and here's that same classic look for all of $87 by Bulova today in 2016.  I picked it up with free Prime delivery and it arrives 2 days later.  My first impression.... Simple and just what I was looking for dressing up my wrist, with out trying to make any more of a statement than: ""This watch looks good on me and with what I'm wearing.""... The one con: I'm going to have to buy a better quality band, the one it came with will let me enjoy it right away, but I don't believe it will last more than a year or so.  So understanding that yes, the rich do have their philanthropic duty to purchase $25,000 dollar watches, I on the other hand look just as good in my Grand Fathers Bulova..... Anyone want to go to Dairy Queen tonight for a tasty treat?"
4,"I like my earrings I like my earrings, they arrived promptly. I was able to wear them without my ears turning red or being irritated. They were larger than I thought they would be, but that is my issue, not the earrings! I ordered a second set, the smallest pair listed on Amazon &amp; they also do not cause any irritation. Again, they too were larger than I wanted for everyday wear. I wish my ""real"" ones were as comfortable as these &amp; that these came smaller."
5,"Top value for money For the price this backpack is amazing. Travelled to Japan with it straight after purchase and found all the compartments useful. Love having a pocket against my back where I could hide my wallet and travel documents safely."

5,"Mounting putty is a good item to have around the house I used the mounting putty to keep a statue in place. I also use it to keep other items in place on shelves. It works well. I have a shadow box that keeps pulling away from the wall I used a little bit of mounting putty at the top and it sticks to the wall no longer pulling away. No need to use nails to put more holes in walls. If I want to move in ething it's easy to just take off the mounting putty."
5,"Good belly rings and good price Not bad for the price and they are very cute looking. The only thing that I’ve noticed about them is that they seem just a bit shorter to me or maybe I just got used to my older belly button jewelry but other than that no issues!"

5,"Holds Up and Manufacturer Backed This is officially the longest I have ever taken to review an Amazon purchase.  After more than five years and constant use, I was considering replacing my Drifter II Backpack.  It wasn't that it was in terrible shape, one of the comfort straps I hardly ever used broke and the top handle was cracked.  As I said, It has seen hard-use almost daily for about five and a half years.  I keep it packed heavy sometimes carrying 2 or more 15"" laptops home/school/work + power supply &amp; cords, books etc.). Average packed weight ~40 pounds.  As I was shopping I was surprised to see this model is still being made and has a lifetime warranty for the purchaser.  Thanks to Amazon, I still had my receipt.  I thought I would give it a try and asked for a replacement from Targus.  (I sent the pictures showing the wear.)  To my surprise, they stood by it.  65 months after purchase, they said ship it to us and we will replace it.  Now I have a brand new one and I am happy as a clam.  I was only out the return shipping cost.  I will buy again from any company who stands by their product like this.  As devices continue to get smaller and lighter, I have no trouble believing this will last a lifetime of computers, text books, e-readers and such for anyone who gets it today."

5,"Super cute necklaces Super cute designs, I personally love which ones have two connected necklaces. A couple are longer than others which is perfect for layering them. They were a little brighter of a silver than expected, but I still love them so much."
5,"Car charm Satisfied with purchase."
5,"Quality bag under-priced for the value given. I paid $27 and change for this...easily its worth double.  Lots of pockets, dividers, organizers, etc.  I moved everything over from a $180 Camelbak bag without issue and I don't feel a huge difference in terms of feel or quality.  If, like me, you prefer a non-descript bag that is a single color, look no further.  I could have bought 6+ of these for the price of the other bag I mentioned and would have been able to outfit my entire family with a bag to store away in the closet.  There is a built-in headphone cable built right into one of the straps...female on the strap to plug in your headphones and then male inside the top most small pocket where you could store a phone or iPod to stream music from.  While I'll never use the feature thought it's a bell or whistle for some perhaps worth noting.  I can't speak to the bag's durability yet, but seriously, even if it lasts a year or two, I've gotten my money's worth."
5,"Make the jump. I have never bought premium staples. Why would you? I will tell you that these really are AMAZING. They were suggested for a recent metal heavy duty swing line stapler, which reviews said would jam with basic staples, which I’ve always bought. I will not go back to picking up staples at any old store, especially for this price. I have not had any jams with the stapler using these staples, and I use it everyday."
2,"Doesn't stick to cardboard! I purchased this for moving and although I found the tape sufficiently thick, I had serious problems with it adhering to the boxes.  It would just lift off of the cardboard causing quite a few box bottoms to pop open, spilling and damaging the contents.  I ended up using 2 to 3 times the amount of tape I would normally use and had to purchase a couple rolls of the much higher priced brand named tape to put over this to prevent it from lifting."
3,"Runs very small Overall it was a cute outfit however it runs a size too small. I typically wear a US size 14, 5'2 and 184 lbs with 40DD chest and I can usually wear a L or XL.  I order this in XL and is didn't work for me. The top was very tight and the pants were a tad bit on the tight side as well.  If you have a smaller chest, this size may work for you. Also the material was light weight nylon/polyester which I didn't expect and the gold lettering was very gold/yellow. For how short I am, the pant leg length actually worked well. Returning for a larger size."

5,"Perfect Finally stretching my 2nd holes since my 1st holes are pretty big. Love the color. Great quality"
5,"Looks like a professional job. Easy to install.  Looks great.  I did not have to cut it.  After installing the piece with screw holes, I removed the cables off the TV, held them against the installed portion,at TV height, then placed the cover over it, and slid it down.  I then reconnected the HDMI and optical cables.  The TV plug was at the opposite end of the TV, from my cables.  I added a second set. The wall mount prevented me from sliding the cover down, and the floor stopped me from sliding it up.  Cutting was an option.  Instead, I placed the plug cord in the holder with screw holes, placed the cover over it, and then pressed the cover into the holder until it snapped in. The same way you snap a lid on a refrigerator bowl.  Worked fine.  Using a second set for just one plug may seem like overkill, but it really balances the setup, and looks great."
5,"... juniors sizing so I sized up and they fit perfect. I'd been looking for what I wore in ... I knew they were juniors sizing so I sized up and they fit perfect. I'd been looking for what I wore in highschool and found these and they're exactly what I loved about my pairs I had back in the day. The cotton assures no chaffing, not too tight, not too short and with the little skits on the sides they don't strangle your thigh. Love."
5,"Absolute favorite thing I bought in 2018! By far my favorite purchase! It is so comfortable. I bought it so I could throw it on after working out in the pool. It's perfect for that. I also got a black one which I love just as much. It's great to wear on cold nights or to take out the trash. I've even worn it work and got sooo many compliments. Highly recommend."

5,"clear sound This Bluetooth device provides distinguished clear sound which creates a pleasant listening experience. One small tip that worth mentioning is that you would want to pair both Bluetooths at the same time. Otherwise, it requires unpairing one and then pairing them both afterward. Additionally, this pair of bluetooth works well for running and exercising as they fit in your ears without getting loose. So you don’t need to worry about losing them while running."
5,"Game Changer About 4 years ago I noticed menstrual cups in a health food store, and ever since then I have kept the thought in the back of my mind to try it but I didn't see the justification for $40 back then if I didn't even know if it would work for me. I have been watching a bunch of Femmehead Youtube videos and she has encouraged me to take the leap, which is how I found out about the OrganiCup brand.  I did some more research about the cups and figured this brand and the price were the best fit for me, and I was not wrong with that thought. They say that it usually takes three cycles to get the hang of it, I had a great system down by day 2 of my period. Since I typically have a lighter period, I only changed my cup morning and night, and it worked great. This makes it so much easier for my job also, because I am constantly on the go or on the road in a truck, it fits my lifestyle needs greatly. This is soooo much better than a pad or tampon any day. When I first had my period I started with pads and those got old fast which is why I switched to tampons, which after a while were irritable and annoying.  This cup is very comfortable to wear around, it made me feel like I didn't even have a period. Everyone who writes articles about any menstrual cup says they wished they started sooner and I completely understand that now. I used to think they were out of their minds because at the time I was not on board with the cup idea yet. This is brand is great, the packaging is great, has directions on the box along with helpful links. The cup came with a little canvas bag to place the cup in. I honestly am so thankful I found this cup in particular because I love it so much."
5,"Bargain price for mechanical pencil lead! Pentel products are pretty consistent, which is why I keep coming back.  I still had a couple sticks in my old container and emptied two of the ones in this set into it.  I guess the third container can sit in my desk.  Never had breakage problems with Pentel lead, although I think the 0.7 mm size has something to do with it as well.  I know these are 'guaranteed to scan' in Scantron tests, but I still have a lucky wooden pencil for that job, so I can't attest to this lead's ability to do that."

Not sure why it says reinforced at the knees, and haven't tested it beyond walking from the car to the cafe, but it does have an extra zip pocket on the front thigh area which can fit my iPhone 6 and credit cards/ID.  I like the snaps for different lengths because if I get cold it can be longer but when it gets inconvenient like scrambling I can have them up."
2,"Good design, poor quality = low confidence I will start by saying it will fit my oversized Lenovo P72 laptop which is good.  But, to be frankly honest, I have decided not to use this bag because immediately when I attempted to put my wireless earbuds into the small flap pocket for such, it tore on one side rendering the headphone pocket unusable.  With this low quality of stitching for something as mundane as earbuds, I will not risk it carrying my heavy laptop for fear that the quality of that slot could be as inferior as the previously mentioned pocket.  I will find another bag that will accommodate my size/weight laptop, which gives me confidence the computer will be safe in based on quality of the product."
3,"Nice pandora. Nice pandora... only the pearl snap closure is hard to handle trying to put the bracelet on.. a clasp is much better. Other than that it is pretty."
1,"Broke in 1st 30sec. I used it! Broke in the 1st 30 seconds I used it.  Everything looks really nice but the spinner that moves the immersed attachment is plastic,  it stripped while being used on fully cooked beans for a soup base... I am not happy!"
1,"Way too over scented I had to toss this toilet bowl cleaner out even before trying it as the fragrance was simply too overpowering, even as it was still in the package.  I cannot imagine the scent with it open and in the toilet bowl for a few weeks."
4,"this watch was a great purchase. I usually always wear an ironman digital ... As a long-time Timex wearer, this watch was a great purchase. I usually always wear an ironman digital watch for the pure durability and functionality of it, but I decided to try something with a little bit more refinement to it for a more casual, slightly dressed up look in my day to day wear. The weekender is solid, looks very nice, and I like the indiglo feature on the entire watchface. It's very easily readable.  The biggest must-have for any watch for me is it has to be comfortable enough for me to wear it the entire day without noticing it on my wrist at all unless I'm looking at it. The weekender definitely achieves this as it's one of the most comfortable watches I've ever worn.  My only gripe I have is that the nylon NATO-style band that comes with the watch is of pretty flimsy quality - the edges are slightly frayed and its just a simple, flat band. I would have liked it more if the edges were at least stitched to prevent the frayed, fuzzy look and it had a little more thickness to it. That is my only gripe at all with this watch."
4,"Small and effective I understand that robot vacuums are not meant to replace regular cleaning, but the Eufy is pretty effective. On day one, it removed all the crumbs that the kids left around the dinner table. On day 2, it completed a 2 hour tour and cleared all the dust under the beds and couches. The remote comes in handy when I need to guide it to a specific location. I also have a roomba for another floor, and this works so much better. It's narrower and not as tall as the roomba, so it gets between chair legs like a champ. It's quieter and also doesn't bump into everything repeatedly when compared to the roomba. The only issue I've faced is that it pushed it's charging station off to the side then could't dock itself until I fixed it. A heavier base or some adhesive should fix this. The only thing I would like to see improved is the Eufy home app should have a activity log. The roomba tells me when it last cleaned, how long it cleaned for, and if it ran into any issues (trapped, dust bin full, etc). Otherwise, it has great battery life (over 2 hours) and decent dust bin capacity."
4,"Very cute Very cute. They are plastic bags filled with acryllic."
5,"don't make the milk too hot It works great. It is difficult to tell exactly how much milk your baby has drunk with this. However, my baby gulps much less air because of the nice collapsing liner. Defiantly worth it."
5,"I absolutely am a huge fan of tape dispensers! I love tape dispensers so much that I gave them as Christmas gifts one year, and other friends who had never tried them before, became instant fans.  That was 35 years ago! It is very hard to find the refills unless you go to an office supply store, so I am ever so grateful that I could order these through Amazon. Thank you! Everything arrived well, minus sand that somehow had gotten into some of the shipment. However, it did not affect the tape or dispenser. Overall, an excellent purchase."
5,"Just what I needed Love this bag. It's exactly what I was looking for. The backpack functionality is perfect for traveling and the briefcase functionality is great for more professional settings. Easy to convert from one to the other, and looks great either way. I'm 6'1""/190 lbs and the backpack fits me perfectly. Does not look too small or too large. Zippers and materials seem sturdy. Not a ton of separate compartments, but plenty enough for me. There's a space for a laptop and separate space for a tablet which is nice."
5,"Always quality I have been wearing Life is Good T-shirts for decades and they are still, soft, fun and easy care."
5,"Great sound and value! I have had these buds for a few days. To put things in a proper context, these are probably the tenth set of buds that I have owned over the last 10-12 years. All of my previous buds were wired. The most recent pair are Klipsch x20i buds which were about $550. I love them. They are hands down the best buds I've ever heard. Close enough to my reference over-ear headphones and well worth what I paid. Now that I have an Apple watch, I wanted to get some true wireless buds to use with it. I researched for several days and narrowed my focus to these buds, the Klipsch T5, the Sony WF-1000XM3, and the B&amp;O E8 2.0. I focused on reading as many reviews of all of these buds from audiophile-centered sites. All four are highly regarded. Different strengths and weaknesses. But price is something that cannot be debated. These buds cost at least 30-40% less than each of their competitors. Although, I would have no problem paying whatever it costs to get the best sound, I decided that I should try these first. If I liked them, I would save at least $100. I don't just like them, I love them. I have gone back and forth between them and my $550 wired Klipsh buds. There is very little to discern between them. If I had to stretch, I'd say that the mids are more detailed (but only VERY slightly) with the Klipsch buds. As with all buds, fit is the key. You have to try all of the supplied tips to see which will get you the tightest fit. Without a good fit, all buds are garbage. With good fit, you get an accurate picture of what the buds can produce. Once, I found my best fit (nice and snug) these buds have plenty of bass. I don't go for the overly-driven Beats sound. Pay no attention to the one star reviews that criticize these buds for having no bass response. I can guaranty that the reviewers either do not know how to seat buds, do not like the way they feel seated and thus don't seat them properly, or, these people think ""proper"" sound is what you hear and feel at a rave. The bass produced by these buds is clean and accurate. My go-to reference material for all audio testing is the Steely Dan Asia album. In my opinion, just about the cleanest, most accurate recording job of all time. (I have about 300-400 vinyl albums in my ""collection"" from which to choose. These buds do an amazing job of reproducing what I hear through my Elac tower speakers when I listen to this album.  I can't recommend them more strongly. At $130 these buds are a steal!"
5,"Great product, bad shipping method. I’m really happy with this product. It looks even nicer in person. I got it as a gift and know that they will love it. A little disappointed in the packaging. It came in a padded envelope. Thankfully the watch is in a tin with foam lining to protect it but the outer box for the product was destroyed and looked like it might have been old stock. The watch is unharmed, but when giving a gift that I purchased new, I expect all aspects to look brand new."
5,"Great bang for your buck. We haven't given these the full wear over time test, but initial impressions are really good...particularly if you factor in price.  My wife loves wearing wool socks around the house without slippers and she will give them a major evaluation to wear.  Like most wool socks these ""pill"" but most folks buying these are looking for comfort and wear as primary factors.  The first of those, comfort, is where most of my evaluation comes from.  They also fit a size 8.5 women perfectly and she gives them a plus where keeping her feet warm on those mornings here in N. Idaho where our house drops down and yet remain comfortable once it warms up."
5,"Carhartt does it again... Great product What does backpack as a gift for my son ... he loves it. Great value for the money paid product was delivered when promised. Carhartt is a good brand you cannot go wrong."
5,"great quality but it definitely runs small! i'm usually a med/large when buying shirts and to bought XXL to be on the safe side. i think i could've gotten away with XL but i like the XXL, the shirt runs longer and i like a slightly looser fit with rash guards. that aside, these shirts are really great! everyone in my bjj classes were really impressed that they were so affordable and the quality was really nice! wicks away sweat immediately and the fabric is strong and good quality. can't recommend it enough for women who do grappling!"
5,"A Dieter's Dream! I loved this little blender!  So cool to use and easy to charge.  It made the shakes so thick, too.  Then my knucklehead son broke it.  I've ordered another one, so hopefully we'll be onto making shakes again really soon!  I definitely recommend this!  I mean, it fit in your ""Mommy Purse,"" it is quiet when it operates, you can charge it with the car charger....this little thing is da bomb!"
5,"soft and light for summer and FLORIDA perfect. it's amazing how i can find what i need without having to drive all over and see things that are not age appropriate or too expensive. AMAZON has amazing choices . makes my  life easy. i needed a comfy lightweight hoodie for air conditioning here and this is 100% perfect"
5,"Great quality and fit for the price - not see through! I ordered these leggings after a ""what people are buying on Amazon today"" Buzzfeed post went up where they were mentioned, and I'm glad I took the risk to order them. They are made of a nice, thick material and aren't at all see through when you are moving in them. I ordered a size small, and I'm 5'2"" and around 120-125lbs...I typically wear around a size 4-6. They are made to fit tight and don't sit too low on my hips when bending and moving around, but they are lower rise. If you are particularly tall or want them to pull down over the top of a pair of figure skates, you may want to try ordering up a size for extra length.  If you want an inexpensive pair of leggings/athletic tights/workout pants and don't want to spend a ton, these are a great deal for the quality of the product you are receiving. They fit and feel great and I hope they will hold up to all the workouts, skating sessions and general wear I'm about to subject them to!"
5,"This is wonderful! We use this grinder daily for coffee beans. I have used it for grinding coriander seeds, and it did that just as well. It is a nice size, and looks good on the counter. It is easy to use, and easy to clean.  I actually can get most of the coffee grounds out just by brushing around with the edge of a plastic measuring spoon, since the grounds want to stick by static electricity after you run the grinder.  But I have used the bread grinding trick before and after the coriander seeds, and it worked great. You may want to use a rubber gripper to pull the lid off, and unplug it before you do that, since the button to grind is on the lid.  The rubber gripper will give you a lot more control easing that lid off slowly so you don't throw grounds all over the counter. This is about my favorite small appliance (in a close race with the toaster)."
5,"There tampons....lol What’s not to love about the tampons in which you use to collect blood flowing out of your body? LOL  But seriously, great tampons for my rare heavy days"
2,"what a bad flaw in an otherwise perfect microwave As others have reported the weird glass tray rotation ""skips"" and ""clunks"" from time to time...what a bad flaw in an otherwise perfect microwave."
3,"Low Watts, Long Cook Time This microwave is pretty okay I guess. You get what you get for your money spent. But the wattage is super low and takes forever to heat things up, especially frozen foods. And the ""Add 30 Sec"" button does not work."
3,"Like others have also noted strap is very short I've had this watch for about a year now. I purchased because I wanted something rugged, truly water proof and stylish. So here are my thoughts. Like others have also noted strap is very short. I have a small wrist so not a problem for me but if you have a large wrist you will find the band too small. The digital display cannot be read because the minute hand blocks the display for 20 mins out of every hour or 1/3 of the time which is very annoying. The numbers in the digital display are also very small. Forget about seeing in the dark, the light is useless as are the glow in the dark hands. I do think the watch looks nice and the gshock does take lots of abuse.  If they could fix the above items they would have a 5 star product."
1,"Never Charged - Defective Product I didn’t process my return fast enough (my fault) so now I’m left with a defective product. The battery never charged- not once. I followed the directions as they were written. I was so excited for this product but it was a total waste of about $40. I unfortunately have to give this item at least 1 star, so let’s say that’s for the concept itself."
1,"Okay but read edit added 8/19 Okay for the price.  I can't hook it up as a wireless printer because my router's password is all upper case and I can't enter upper case into the display of the printer.  EDITED:  After less than a year this printer is garbage.  I bought a non HP toner cartridge, which worked great for about 20 copies, then the printer started giving me messages about the ""non HP cartridge"".  After unsuccessfully unloading and reloading the bogus cartridge, I sucked it up and bought HP cartridges, 2 of them.  I get the identical message and it IS an HP cartridge.  I have tried unplugging, turning on and off and everything else I can think of.  At this point the thing won't even turn on.  All I get is the HP symbol and striped lines on the screen and a flashing light.  It has been doing that for about 8 hours today and the only way it goes away if if I unplug the printer.  I had the same happen yesterday.  So, I wasted money on this printer AND I wasted money on real HP toner cartridges that the machine won't accept.  I told my husband to open the door and the printer is getting tossed onto the patio where I hope it gets broken into little pieces.  It is pure garbage.  I will not be buying another HP printer."
4,"Nice Nice"
4,"Good quality, but very heavy fully packed Here's my disclaimer: I tried this backpack and thought it was good, but realized when I did a test pack I can't comfortably carry it fully packed for any length of time. Turns out I am a suitcase/carry-on person for travel, but if I WERE to be a travel backpack person, this would be the backpack I use. I was very impressed with the quality: the shoulder straps are padded, and I particularly liked the chest strap to better distribute weight. Though it was a bit of a squeeze, I did get one pair of sneakers, three days worth of clothes (dress, jeans, tops, sweater, underwear), a small toiletry kit, my makeup bag, odds and ends bag, Kindle Fire, large wallet, crossword book, and my phone into the backpack. The zippers are sturdy and I never felt like the bag was going to split, and the outside side clips helped compress and hold it together. The front pockets could have been slightly better designed, but still fit everything I needed, and I liked the key clip. The inside zippered pouch could only fit thin things, but it is nice to have the separation. It's doable to get three-days worth of stuff in this backpack, but will be heavy and make you a wide load (I kept bumping into things, not used to how large it stood off my back fully packed). That all said, if you want to travel hands-free, this is a great backpack to use!"
4,"Nice jersey fabric, modified regulat fit Comfortable shirt, very soft fabric. Just what my husband wanted. The cut is a tad slimmer than traditional fit. I hope it doesn't shrink when washed several times."
5,"Love these pants! Love these pants! So comfortable &amp; lightweight!"
5,"Great for travel/ work I bought this backpack to use for work tradeshows and it was perfect.  It fits the things I need without being too large.  It has enough pockets but not too many.  I found it to be very handy while traveling.  I could access the things I needed easily, without rummaging around, and store receipts, etc. as well."
5,"Great versatile bag especially for travel Love this bag. Great quality for the price. Used it as a backpack and carry-on bag during my two week vacation. Very good for a weekender bag."
5,"Outstanding Quality!! STURDY!! True color!! Oh my! This is the perfect size for my 5th grade (5 ft) daughter! She loves it! The charging usb port works great! (We bought a power bank from a separate company and attached it to the internal cord that came installed in the backpack) The bag is very good quality! Color: cyan ..It is truly cyan. Front outter pouch zips and is very spacious! Inside, it has good room to fit her drawing supplies (colored pencils, drawing/schetch pad, folders, a 3"" thick metal lunchbox for her colored pencils, and glasses hard case... leaving even more room for library books and school homework items! Mind you, this is all possible when having her iPad in the cushioned sleeve area! (The only thing I would change in the design of this backpack is the placement of the pockets INSIDE the top front of the bag. When completely unzipped, they potentially could fall if the front of the backpack is pushed over/folded forward BUT the material is firm enough to stay up on it's own most of the time. ) Delivery was on point! As promised! No signature required This backpack is also water resistant. We will update this review when we have to deal with rain. I felt the material and it has some type of waterproof feel to it. I don't doubt it will hold up (no scuba diving with it though!) This was a GREAT purchase!! I google reviewed over 20 backpacks with chargers and a YouTube video about a girl going back to school finally gave me a glimpse before I bought this. The research was worth it and hopefully it helps someone else with their decision. P.S.  I bought an Asurion 4-year warranty which covers rips, broken handles, and defects in the future. I would highly recommend you purchase that as well!! (It was $4.99 on 8/3/2018) I am very very very happy with this purchase!  Oh...and so is my daughter! Thanks a bunch!"
5,"Works Quickly! Thankfully, this worked quickly! Saved me a trip to the doctor!"
5,"Just wow! I couldn't afford another pair of Jabras but still wanted something with a decent sound. After ploughing through loads of different reviews for various headphones I went for these. All I can say is wow! Chuffed to bits! Really is hard to believe I'm listening through a pair of budget headphones. Great sound quality, the buds fit comfortably into your ear and I’ve experienced no pain / aching after over 5 hours of constantly wearing them.  Worth the purchase overall!"
5,"A great gift! I got this for my boyfriend, and he loves it. It’s not too big, and looks perfect on his wrist. A lot of people have complained about the loud ticking, but you can’t ever hear it unless you’re paying attention to it."
5,"indescribable The watch is beautiful, comfortable!!! I'm very happy with the product !!"
5,"Five Stars We love this microwave! It's small and heats well, and those are our only specifications."
5,"Great Great microwave and big enough for my Big Family!"
5,"Great flavor and excellent price! I absolutely love this coffee for the excellent and consistent flavor that it provides.  Being able to buy it in bulk at 100 K-cups per case reduces the price per cup of coffee significantly more than purchasing a typical package of K-cups from the local grocery store!  My friends and neighbors have tried the coffee at my invitation, and they all  have been impressed by the flavor of it as well."
5,"Amazing quality ! Ordered a medium because I prefer a loser fight. It fit as I expected on a 5'2 women around 130 pounds. I like how the sleeves are not baggy and  fit very well so I don't need to roll them up.  I also liked how the collar part of the jacket has a warm material, so when it is cold it provides warm around your neck when zipped up. The hood is a great size, very comfortable to wear when raining or when it is a warm - cool day . Another thing that I like about this jacket is the length. Because I am 5'2 it fits right below my hips, I prefer a longer length jacket and this was truly perfect. It wasn't so short that I have to keep pulling down, it fits great. Overall I've had this jacket for a few weeks and have been 100% satisfied with its durability and quality, recommend for any daily use , its light wight but can be layered with a sweater under but it does include a incredible feature, the warm sweater like material around the neck/hoodie area."
5,"Nice design, good quality This can is well made with non sharp edges, non smelly, seems durable and a bit bigger than I thought which is a good thing. Indoor, color Bronze looks almost like brown, but  under natural light, it appears like Amazon picture, just a bit lighter. However its not elegant metallic look as I hoped. It has matte finish exterior and polish interior, the bottom width is 8.5"" to 13.5"" at top ; height is 11"" - 13"" from lowest to highest point and 6"" depth. In the picture below, I lined it up with 4 gallons waste bag, and put it next to the slippers for you to compare the size. Finally, this trash can is still my good purchase thanks to the quality, stylish and modern design at an affordable price."
2,"Not true to size I had a breast lift with augmentation. I preciously ordered a zip down sports bra, but the surgeon suggested one with more support and a front closure. I ordered a XL and it still didn't fit and the I there wasn't much support."
3,"If you're looking for something to snuggle up in, order up a size. If you want to layer underneath this pullover, buy a size up. These are true to fit, maybe even running a tad small. If you're muscular in the arms/shoulders, def order a size up"
1,"Would not purchase again. Filters do not fit within the chamber well and the coffee does not taste the same as when the Keurig filters are used. I informed the seller of this, &amp; they didn't offer to replace them."
1,"Comparison review/rating to older model Bought the 2017 model to replace an older Cuisinart which after many years of service died. The older model could be operated with one hand only. The 2017 model can only be operated with both hands which for me is very painful due to medical reasons which limit the use of my right hand. Still I manage, but not with ease. I loved the older version. If Cuisinart does not change the design back to how it was, I will not buy another one from them. Actually, the one I have now, I will use until I find another maker who offers a hand blender which can be operated with one hand and once I find one, this model will immediately go out with other donations."
1,"NOT HYPOALLERGENIC FALSE ADVERTISING The title states HYPOALLERGENIC. They are not!!!! I’m allergic to silver and zinc. Anyways, I’ve ordered hypoallergenic earings off other sellers and haven’t had any issues. I ordered these and within a few hours of wearing the earings my ears caught an allergic reaction which has never happened to me with hypoallergenic earings. Product is terrible will never order again."
4,"Size 12 Pants = large Im a size 12 regular in pants and ordered the large. It technically fit pretty well with the exception of how loose the crotch/hip area was. Material is very nice. Only has one pocket. Returned the items because i didnt exactly love them. The material was pretty squat proof."
4,"Nice, almost perfect G-Shock Needed to replace my Casio G-Shock GW5600 who's display died, and decided to get something with a little bigger display. I have always used the Countdown Timer on my Casio watches on a daily basis, so when I ran across the GD350, it looked like the perfect watch as it has a one push short cut button to the countdown timer. I also liked the idea of the Vibrate feature since I can't always hear the beep in noisy environments, or it's too loud for others. I didn't need a compass, or tides, or altimeter to clutter up the interface...there are other watches for that. All I needed was a countdown alarm, stopwatch, and regular, setable alarm. Here is a breakdown of what I think...  Pros -  1. Nice, large, readable display, with a two tone color scheme that makes the time stand out from the date. 2. Almost all day comfort - I rarely take my watch off and forget it's on sometimes. 3. Vibrate alarm. 4. Quick launch of the countdown timer. I use my CT every day, and it's nice to get to it directly. 5. Multiple alarms - don't need THAT many, but has them. 6. One Time option for alarm. I use an alarm for Street Sweeping every other week, and nice to have the one-time option if you only need it to go off once, or not often. 7. Snooze available on alarm. 8. Wife likes the Manly style, but it's not TOO big. 9. Wings keep it from rotating on my wrist, but don't make it uncomfortable -this will vary by your own wrist size/shape. 10. Bright, backlight with three duration settings, which can be set to automatically turn on with the twist of your wrist. 11. Backlight easy to access with G button 12. Distinctive beep when you cycle back to the timekeeping screen makes it easy to quickly return to Time. 13. Attractive style -  thought I'd dislike the grayish color after all my previous Casios were black, but it's growing on me.  Cons -  1. Alarm could be louder, with adjustments. 2. Vibrate could be a little stronger, AND no way to set the alarms to vibrate AND beep...it's one OR the other :-(. 3. World Time is first screen after Time?? Put that at the end, and preferrably, Casio should allow custom ordering of functions. 4. Strap is a little more difficult to unbuckle than my DW5600...probably the double tongue buckle. 5. A little light bleed from the LED backlighting a little distracting, and should have a couple levels of brightness. The older Luminescence on my DW5600 was cooler looking and more even, though it wasn't always bright enough. 6. A little compilcated to set up, but sure I just need time with it."
5,"Excellent Buy Invicta is a real piece of art. The nice gold bracelet and blue color makes a great impressive look."
5,"Brother P-touch Tape Proven technology. Sticks well, yet comes off easily. I've been using P-touch labels probably since 2000. If you download and install the Brother P-touch editor software (free download from Brother, however, you WILL need to have your machine's serial number at hand to be able to download the software), you can totally customize any label with other fonts AND add a small image on the label!"
5,"Amazing product I love this product! It was shipped out so fast! The material is amazing. My husband travels a lot for work and this is perfect and safe for his job."
5,"I LOVE THESE PENS!! I bought two types of FriXion pens and these are my favorite.  Those of us who are used to the 'old school' erasable pens from the 80's and 90's are in for a very pleasant surprise!  These erase so cleanly and with no icky little bits left behind.  The colors are great, they write fairly smoothly and dry quickly on the paper for gel pens.  Normally I don't care for gel pens because they tend to smear, but these do not!  Looking forward to having an excuse to buy more of these!"
5,"My Favorite Flavor I have tried basically all of the flavors for this specific Nespresso maker, and this is definitely my favorite for the morning. I am definitely a coffee fanatic, but some of the choices can be a little aggressive for me first thing in the morning. This seems to be the perfect combo of strength and smoothness, with a slightly nutty flavor."
5,"Coffee filters I have two coffee pots these just like the ones that came with the coffee pots. They work very well."
5,"Innovative Design Great wireless earphones. They function wonderfully fit snuggly so they don’t stick out half a mile from your ear. The multi function button works great. It has a nice crisp feel to it. I use them around the office and people can’t tell that I have them on when making calls. The greatest part is that they are so light weight. I can wear them for hours and it doesn’t feel like something is weighing against my ears. On thing that is different about these are the removable ear buds. They don’t grab onto the earphone the same as my wife’s pair. These actually suction against the earphone to hold on. It’s a pretty innovative design. All in all I like them."
5,"Great watch! I am more then happy with it Great watch! I am more then happy with it. It is the perfect size and looks great on the wrist."
5,"The perfect computer/tech backpack Awesome bag. Perfectly sized compartments, well padded separate computer and tablet slots that fit my large Apple devices well. And, it’s comfortable and looks great. Excellent construction I expect to last many years to come. Fantastic for traveling."
5,"Five Stars beautiful watch"
5,"cool backpack Got this on a flash sale and it was worth it and more! it is super durable and sturdy, and has just the right amount of compartments. the back is breathable and has a little pocket to put keys or something easily accessible. the only thing i don’t really see the need for is the charger, the backpack itself doesn’t have a battery, so you have to plug the backpack into a power bank, and then plug your device into the backpack. pretty inefficient but a neat concept."
5,"Great Microwave! This microwave is similar to what I ... Great Microwave! This microwave is similar to what I had and love it. I would recommend this microwave to anyone."
5,"I love everything about it I love everything about it!!!! Very stylish, I especially love the ease of operating! The Breville brand never disappoints me with the quality of their kitchen appliances."
2,"It's probably the stapler I got in particular that doesn't function very well. It's probably the stapler I got in particular that doesn't function very well, but sometimes it has difficulty properly directing the prongs of the staples on the reverse side. Rather than follow the curve of the receptacle and hook around, they often will mash flat and cause the staple to not fully penetrate.  I've used these for years with no troubles, so I likely have a dude, but the only solution I've found is to staple firmly and quickly for it to function properly."
3,"Good cheap option for taping walls for painting/Use in Conjunction with the Green or Yellow for Perfect Wall Painting Results!! Good cheap option for taping walls for painting.  Doesn't stick as well as the ""Green"" colored version, from this company, but it is much cheaper.  Also, I don't use this product for the finer edges, where paint bleeding is a concern.  I use the thin green or yellow for areas that are critical and this blue tape on top of the better stuff, to keep down costs.  Great for this application."
3,"Taste is different Did not taste the same as the pods I ordered from Nespresso."

4,"Nice backpack Brought this backpack for travel and was pleasantly surprised when it arrived. Very roomy bag with good style and safety features. I just had to get use taking it on and off to get in it, but loved the hands free travel."
4,"Great Running shoe, great colors Love the way these look and feel.  I always buy this type of running shoes. It typically works best for my feet.  Unfortunately, I've been having some knee pain and I'm not sure if it is the shoe or a coincidence.  That is the only reason I don't give a  star."
4,"Bonito reloj Reloj bonito"
5,"Lightweight and durable I got this for my brother for traveling and he likes it a lot. He was able to put a lot of things in the bagpack and it doesn't feel heavy at all. It also have a strap at the back where you can strap it on the the carry on. There is a usb connector on the side which is super useful."
5,"Great inexpensive high waisted leggings I ordered these strictly based on the positive reviews and I’m sure glad I did. I have already ordered a second pair in another colour. I wanted high waisted to avoid muffin top or digging in. These are great. They manage to stay up and keep things smooth without any elastic or cutting in at odd spots. Also, as someone who is only 5’3” I have a really hard time finding yoga pants that are not miles too long for me. These are perfect! They hit right at my ankle perfectly.  Sizing wise I am usually an extra small to small, but after reading the reviews on here I decided to order down a size. I order an XXS and they fit perfectly. They are super comfortable and I love the soft smooth material. The dog fur doesn’t stick, so bonus. Lol. A few people mentioned pilling when they washed them. I have not yet experienced that. As a precaution I have been turning them inside out when I wash them though. I am so happy with these. I plan on also buying a pair in the capri version. I would love to see more colour options!"
5,"Sweet bracelet This is a normal Alex and Ani bracelet but the charm supports a charity. And, we all have someone who is 'our sunshine'. Great gift!"
5,"Detox Really good detox my vagina it felt new"
5,"I love these. Great fit and so comfortable! They are nice and long. They actually stay at my ankles instead of riding up, even after multiple washes. I ordered a large because I've got a big booty and I'm tall so I wanted them long enough. The fit is amazing and they are very flattering. The material is perfect for everyday wear. Not super thin, but with bending over the butt area may get a little see-through. Ordering another pair!"
5,"This is absolutely beautiful. It was easy to get pictures in if ... This is absolutely beautiful.  It was easy to get pictures in if you follow the directions.  I can't believe what a good deal.  Packaged nicely and great quality.  The chain is beautiful as well."
5,"The Ultimate in Laptop Protection Love, love, love this backpack. The laptop protection is uncompromising, and there are plenty of pockets in all the right places for an ipad, pens, paper, chargers and anything else you might need. It's the ultimate Swiss Army knife for and tech-head. The only trade-off is that when fully loaded it can get a bit heavy. I'm definitely happy with the design and construction (and so is my MacBook Pro). Well worth the few extra dollars."
5,"Great product! Great product for the price!  I've used it to blend homemade tomato sauce, smoothies and some sauces.  Works very well.  I like the two speed option also.  Can't beat what your're getting for this price!"
5,"Essential for Sterilizing! I didn’t know how essential bottle sterilization was untile I asked my mom. Once I fidgeted out that it was a must I purchased this sterilizer to go with my bottles. This is one of the best investments I made! The sterilizer is a good price and well worth the money. I use this product everyday and I am thankful I don’t have to sterilize the old fashion way! Also- this machine is made to be compatible with othe brands aside from Dr Browns but if you have Dr.Brown bottles it’s really nice because it is tailored exactly for them."
5,"Gorgeous printing! Bright white and durable paper, no streaking or leaking ink. I used ""best quality"" settings on my printer and I think it was TOO much ink. Normal and draft print show up very nicely."
5,"Very good Very quite. Good quality"
5,"Perfect blender for a personal-on-the-go smoothie! This smoothie blender is the perfect size to make an on the go smoothie! The bottles are BPA-free and have lids with a clip which make it convenient for travel.  When using ice, it is best to use the ULTRA button since it’ll blend for a longer period of time. The blender will not turn on until the bottle is locked in correctly. One thing I would add would be more color options. Overall, great purchase!"
5,"Soft and great quality The material is soft and is of good quality. I will definitely order these again"
2,"Love them, but they broke after three weeks! I love them, they are easy to use, connect to your phone without any problem.

1,"Shrink a lot when washed When I washed them they shrank so much I couldn't even wear them.  I am only 5'3"" and they were above my ankles.  I would have returned them, but assumed I couldn't because they had been washed.  Lucky I have a daughter that is only 5', so hopefully they will work for her.  I will never buy them again."
4,"Comfortable and supportive I usually wear a 40D in Wacoal bras.  I had ordered that size previously but it was very tight feeling and Wacoal suggested a 42D which I ordered.  That fit more like my other bras although there is more fullness in the cups than I really need.  I find many bra materials to be itchy or just uncomfortable even wearing for a short time and wanted just a very basic but up-lifting bra.  This one is that.  I like the support of the bra and it is comfortable to wear but is quite high in the front and I have found that the bra shows there with several of my t-shirt style tops, especially ones with a V neck.  The straps are adjustable and very comfortable as is the hook closure.  I wear this more for an everyday bra rather than a workout bra."
4,"Does what it says - fine line, no odor These are great for working out coding algorithms on a personal-size whiteboard. Probably too fine for others to read on a wall-mounted board.  All the colors are as expected - the green is a little light. You do have to use a very light hand in order to keep the point ultra-fine - every time I lend a pen to someone else, I know it's going to come back with a smooshed tip, but it will still write relatively fine lines.  No odor at all.  Tip #1:  Want a cheap, ultraportable ""whiteboard"" for sketching ideas or algorithm practice? A sheet or two of plain paper/cardstock in a glossy page protector works perfectly, is two-sided, and makes you look pretty badass when you pull out your own ""whiteboard"" and start outlining your plan. Tip #2:  If the tip dries prematurely (left the cap loose for a few hours?), there are ways to revive the ink - warm water, alcohol, centrifugal force - check online."
4,"Nice earbud for the price I bought these to replace the OEM Samsung earbuds that came with my Galaxy S3.  I didn't realize how less then stellar the Samsung OEM earbuds were until I started using these.  They sound great and have worked well with every device they've been used with.  Bass and treble are always good, the earbuds are comfortable to wear for long duration's and the external noise is minimal when in use. For the price, the sound quality is good making it hard to disappoint."

5,"Great product This would be the perfect baby shower gift. If you follow the manufacturers directions this product is safe and easy to use."
5,"Office Headset I'm using this headset paired to my office phone and it's working great.  I'll be picking up a few more of these for some office mates after giving it a few more full days.  The battery lasts all day and the sound has been great.  Since I'm in an office with a closed door noise cancellation is not as much of an issue for me.  I'm yet to pair this to two phones or use it in a loud space.  I'll update this review if that changes.  The problem I has with most BT office headsets was that they too big and uncomfortable to wear all day or the\y are too small and lead to poor call quality.  This is the perfect fit for me.  Comfortable and have not heard a single complain about call quality.  I took a shot with this based on the reviews and for the money it is hard to beat."
5,"Great shirt at a great price. I like that this shirt is so light and cool. I wear it when I’m working inside and outside the house."
5,"Great yoga leggings! Better than I expected, even after having read the reviews. They were almost too good to be true. They are warm, actually have a ""thickness"" to them and are long so my ankles don't have to chill. They are very, very comfortable. I have not washed them yet, but anticipate they will wash well. If they don't, I'll let you know. I'm ordering a couple more pairs and have told my daughter about them.  And... the color was great! Burgundy.  Glad to recommend them."

5,"Love Adidas Backpacks Exactly as advertised. Been using Adidas backpacks for both my kids for at least 10 years. I love the shoulder support and the space.  I bought this particular bag because of the size. Needed to fit a larger laptop in it. Fits great. Definitely a great backpack for a college student. Not bulky, but plenty of space."
5,"Very soft and breathable I work in a busy restaurant where I have to wear a black collared shirt so I decided to give this one a try based on the reviews. Im glad I did. It's incredibly soft and breathable. The cut is flattering and I like that the sleeves are a decent length. A lot of women's shirts have those annoying cap sleeves that are right in your armpit. This is a great shirt for anybody who has to wear a collared shirt in a warm climate."
2,"Zipper Issue I have now had this backpack about 1 year.  I have used it a lot with great results.  Just this week the zipper lost teeth and will no longer close properly.  I have made a warranty claim and will update this post when I hear back.  Very disappointed right now, but hopefully Yeti stands behind the product."

3,"Very large These pants are made of a very pretty and comfortable fabric, unfortunately they are very large. I purchased a medium, I am 5'4 and have a 28"" waist and a 40"" hip. They are loose and stretchy, so they fit great everywhere except for the length. they are a good 5in too long and also have a long rise in the front. These would be great if you are tall."

1,"Well constructed ... but too small I was so excited to find these ... I've been trying to find replacements for my two worn-out Kathy Ireland Seamless Padded Bras, size 3X. These bras looked well-constructed, and the price was right. Unfortunately, in my excitement, I didn't do much research about the sizing ... XXXL does not equal 3X.  The first time I put one of the Cabela's bras on, I couldn't believe how difficult it was to get it on. Once I got it on, I noticed the band was tight, but the cups fit great! So, I decided to go with it. I wore it for about 6 hours before taking it off. The band rolled up, the straps kept falling down. Bummer.  Next day, I decided to cut the band off, which worked like a charm. No more binding band, unfortunately, the straps kept falling down. Again, I took it off after a couple of hours' wear. The one I cut up is in the trash; the two unused ones have gone in the donation pile.  My search continues....."
4,"Good but some of the space is wasted In principle this is quite helpful. I did not give 5 stars because somehow I wish the design allowed for more items to be loaded in. Be aware: save the packaging with the picture: it is a real puzzle to figure out where each part goes in the basket..."
4,"Great for indoor gym goers, runners caution of wind noise Great gym headphones at a great price. I researched bluetooth in-ear headphones extensively and decided on these for the price.  The other reviewers are spot on.  They are light, stay in the ears, have really good battery performance.  They pair quickly and without much effort.  Operation is a no-brainer and they keep me in the zone during long sweaty workouts.  The only disadvantages I see are that the rubber plug that covers the charging port is having a hard time staying in after numerous charges and a couple months of daily use.  They are not the most low-profile ear buds, but they are what you should expect for this style of bluetooth headphones.  I've deducted a full star for one reason... Wind noise. I can't tell if it is due to the larger profile of the headphones, or if it is the microphone input but if you are walking fast / running especially into a slight head wind you will hear the rustling loudly.  Like I mentioned, i'm not sure of the exact cause, but it's really distracting, so much so, I'd recommend these only for indoor use.  If you are a runner, you might want to look another direction."
5,"Very good everyday watch Very good everyday watch. glass is protected from scratches by an elevated edge, time is more accurate than my cell phone.  Atomic receiver updates every night and I only take the watch off to shower so it updates underneath the covers.  I've heard of others having battery charge issues, and my watch has only been on Medium since I got it a few days ago.  So Time will tell if the battery is defective, but I'm going to give it another week or so to see if it gets to high before making a judgement on the battery.  The auto light that comes on when you tilt your wrist is awesome.  And it can easily be turned on/off by holding the light button for 3 seconds.  Very good watch.  Can't ask for much more in a tough solar everyday watch.  Most accurate time on a watch with absolutely no effort needed from me after initial setup of time zone and such.  It says it's +/- 15 seconds a month, but when I opened it up from the box the last update was 4-6 months previously and it was only off by 5 seconds or so.  Overall, this is a great watch.  I just wish that they made the all black version with a non negative display.  If you got this display on the all black model it would be perfect.  Update: the battery is fine. When the battery gets to a certain level it takes longer to recharge. So I left mine outside on the porch for 3-4 days and it was on high after day 2. I left it out just to get the highest possible level of charge."

I can fit my laptop in it and other supplies, it folds out flat easily so you dont have to try n search what ur looking for, you can easily see it once u open the bag. The built in usb is a plus , overall its a great bag n great quality. I would definitely recommend this bag"

I would not hesitate to recommend this type of watch to others."
5,"MOM OF THREE UNDER THREE These are my favorite bottles. I've tried Avent Natural, Avent Classic, Tommee Tippee, Boon Nursh, Dr.Brown, Playtex VentAire, Playtex Drop Ins, Similac, EvenFlo, and of all of these, Nuk Simply Natural is my favorite. They are designed to be healthiest to the dental and mouth pallete. I love how they are NOT made of plastic, or glass, or silicone. They are super easy to wash and see through. Only downfall is, the brand seems to favor breastfeeding so they don't really consider different feeding options when specialty formula feeding (I.e. added cereal). Thickened formula will not fit through the nipple. I really wish they made a variable flow nipple. Then it would be perfect."
5,"Cool, nice, plenty of space. I have now be using Timbuktu for a couple of week. At the beginning I had my troubles as it was different that other bags that I had. I got some nice feedback from people telling it's a cool back. It certainly looks very nice and nicely built. It's a beautiful grey cloth. After using it a couple of weeks, I do love it. It has plenty of place and you still don't feel you are carrying a huge backpack. I event travelled with 2 laptops, magazines, work paper, over the ear headphones, my headphone amplifier, cables etc... no problem. It has a nice space on the side to put your water bottle or.. umbrella. How would this wonderful backpack be even better.. for me.. on the front would be nice to have a deeper pocket. The front pocket with side zipper is great but not for quick things to search like passport, put phone or other little things. Then would be nice to have a sleeve that allows you to slip the back over extended luggage handles. Btw.. it's TSA Friendly, had once the occasion to open the laptop compartment and didn't have problem. I travel a lot, it fits well under the seat in a plane. I was worried about getting dirty as it's kind of a cloth.. but nothing so far. I like my new backpack!"
5,"Cute and comfy no-show socks. Size 9 max. These socks are great. Very comfortable and do not show when I wear my sneakers. They're thin-medium thickness. I wear a size 9.5 and that is definitely the max size they will fit. I would not get them for a size 10 and up, they will be too small. They are perfect for size 9 and under. I like the arch support. They're just standard socks so no extra cushion. Cute color stripes makes it easy to pair together after washing."
5,"Personalizable, engraving on a Solid blue line watch is heavy and lovely. Bought 2 as gifts for my Police officer husband and son. They made emotional, cherished gifts for my men.  The ability to engrave on the sides would be an added plus. Thank you for a wonderful heirloom gift!"
5,"Great fit and quality These are awesome. I will definitely be ordering more of these as they are perfect in the mid-section for tummy control as well as stay put through vigorous activity. They are also extremely comfortable. I recommend them 100%! If you are looking for some shorts with a comfortable fit and a bit more coverage these are the ones for you! I have pretty big hips and some generous thighs (5'7"" and 160 lbs) and the Medium was awesome."
5,"Good product affordable ink One of the few affordable printer ink cartridges available. Works perfectly and arrived on time and as advertised"
2,"Very disappointed I loved this chain when I received it.  It was beautiful and very sturdy looking.  I bought this chain to wear my deceased husbands wedding ring around my neck when my other chain broke.  I noticed after 5 days the chain appeared to darken, there is a small kink in the chain that looks like without much effort the chain will break.  I also noticed that my neck and the back of my neck by the hair line where the chain was started to itch.  Not sure if it is the quality of this sterling silver or what but so disappointed!  I have ordered a white gold chain to replace this one."
3,"It’s OK, but don’t expect much... Received this bag this afternoon. I bought it because I was looking for a durable backpack for hiking and general scavenging purposes. I was prepared to pay a decent price for a good pack that would hold up well and last a LONG time. However when I started doing my research I found that any of the really heavy-duty bags were $200 plus dollars. I wasn’t finding one single bag that seemed like it was the one to buy at the price point so I decided to pick up something cheaper with lots of good reviews to tide me over while I did more research. So I bought this bag based on the description and number of good reviews.  On first impression I was a bit disappointed. The canvas doesn’t strike me s especially durable. It’s what I would expect from any old average canvas bag. Also, as some of the other reviews have noted, there’s really no structure to it. When you set it down it pretty much crumples into a shapeless pile. The straps and latches are not functional on the main top cover. They are strictly cosmetic and there are snaps underneath them that actually do the closing. That kind of bothers me as I hate stuff that serves no actual purpose except cosmetics. The main storage portion of the bag is secured with a rope that ties in the front to cinch it. It doesn’t seem the most secure. There is a zippered small compartment in there but it wouldn’t hold much.  Size wise it’s not what I would call a “large” bag. It’s average sized for a backpack a student might have, maybe at best a little bigger but don’t be deceived- it’s not huge by any means.  Overall, it seems ok. Honestly, I feel like it’s a bit over-priced for what you get. I paid just over $40 for it. I think I would feel a little better about my purchase if it had been around $30. I don’t really feel like it’s anything special and unless all of the other comparable bags in this price point are total crap I don’t understand the abundance of really high ratings for this bag."
1,"These ""Assembled in USA"" markers are not as ultra fine as my last ""Made In USA"" batch These ""Assembled in USA"" markers are not as ultra fine as my last ""Made In USA"" batch.  The writing is not as fine;  thicker and a bit gloppy at times.  So few products stay as good, or truly improve these days.  I'd pay a bit more for the same quality I had, but alas that is not what most companies do."
1,"Loose and edgy dial. The dial on the side is sharp. It can also be loosened and therefore time of the watch can be changed without realizing."
4,"Works fine, good price Works just fine. I purchased this a second drying rack to the Avent one I have. Only docking 1 star since everything is quite crowded on the rack once it's all hanging out to dry. But that's not a deal breaker. It works just fine."
4,"Need a stylish and functional backpack for a 10 year old? The Good: -Stylish -Large compartment which can fit lunch, jacket and tablet if necessary -Soft pocket for delicate items -Comfortable to carry -Well constructed  The Bad: -A bit expensive  The Bottom Line: This bag is probably more for like 10 year olds. The bag has a large compartment that can easily fit lunch, books, jacket and a tablet. It has an outer pocket for other random gear. It is comfortable to carry and well constructed. It’s a great looking backpack for a kid and the black with white adidas print can’t be beat. Overall I would recommend this backpack for a 8-12 year old probably depending on size of your child.  *If you found my review helpful, please let Amazon know by clicking the helpful button below!  **Disclosure: I received a sample product from the Amazon Vine program for an honest and unbiased review."
4,"A Highly Readible, Functional Watch I really like this watch for it's relative simplicity.  It provides high readability and a reasonable array of USEFUL functions, with fairly intuitive programming.  The display is large and quickly readable at a glance.  As noted by others, it IS large and the plastic screen could be easily scratched.  But I've been using a simple fix for scratch-proofing that I've successfully used for years on various watches and instruments with scratch-prone plastic displays.  Namely, cover the display with a cut-out from a clear, self-adhesive plastic sheet of the type used for laminating paper sheets [reports, small signs, etc.] without using a heated laminating machine.  In this case I cut out a three inch square, peeled the back release sheet off, exposing the self-adhesive surface, and applied to the watch face and then trimmed around the plastic display with an Exacto knife having a very narrow, sharp point.  Roll the lamination sheet slowly onto the watch lens to avoid trapping air bubbles.The watch's bezel forms a grove along the plastic lens's edge to easily guide the blade without cutting into the lens itself.  Be slow and deliberate and this will go very well. If not satisfied on the first try, simply peel off and repeat.  Generally I've found this works very well for a few years [or more], and them you simply peel it off [no residue or lens damage] and repeat.  Also, the Indiglo display works very well. Good luck."
5,"Accurate, looks and fits great. I've had this watch for several weeks now, wearing it every day.  The watch is great - keeps time accurately and is easy to read.  Even the day-of-week and date are readable to my 50+ year old eyes. ;-)  The hands are even visible in the dark - once your eyes are adjusted to the darkness the illuminated hands are easy enough to see.  The watch is modest in size and fits well - I don't have large wrists or forearms and it doesn't look or feel out of place or too big.  As others have noted, yes the band is stiff at first, but it softens up after a few days.  I expect it will break in even more in the coming weeks.  The watch was running right out of the box.  I left it under a desk lamp for maybe 15 minutes then wore it that evening (the day it came).  Been running fine ever since.  Seems to work with a daily dose of indoor office lighting. The procedure to set the time, day-of-week, and date is straightforward.  I've done the initial setting, and the date advance from Feb 28 - Mar 1.  I'm not a big jewelry guy, this is my one watch for work, motorcycling (where it may get wet), going out, staying in.  Purely subjective on my part but the classic look of this watch fits in anywhere."
5,"Great sound quality. Fits nicely in my ear and the sound quality is great. The earbuds light up red when it's charging and the red light shuts off once its fully charged. You can use only one earbud if you want, but if you want to start using the second earbud (after you have been using just one) you will need to shut off both and pair the earbuds again. The second earbud will not pair if the other one has been in use. It takes about 3 hours to full charge."
5,"Perfect I’ve been buying sports bras at every fancy high end athletic and lingerie store on earth. They all sucked. This one is PEEFECT. I’m a small C with some migrated breast tissue under one arm. This covers perfectly and is super soft and comfortable. Not recommended for larger chests as it doesn’t offer much support for high impact sports, but ideal for smaller women."
5,"My new favorite everyday earrings! I LOVE these earrings. They are exactly what I was looking for: small, closed-loop silver hoops that can stay in my ears for a long time and not tarnish or get green/irritated. I have 3 piercings per ear and I'm super lazy with wanting to change my earrings. I love just wearing the same versatile styles for months on end. These earring are perfect. They go with everything, have yet to irritate my sensitive ears at all, and best of all, they are a closed loop so I never have to worry about the backs falling off or posts stabbing me in the head at night. I already bought another pair."
5,"This.stuff.works. Listen. This stuff is miraculous. Apologies in advance if this is a long review but I just want to set the stage of the situation I was dealing with. Back in 2015, about 3 months into my pregnancy with my 2nd child, I started getting BV and yeast infections. Up until that point I may have had 2 yeast infections in my entire life, but suddenly it was this ongoing thing that would not go away. At first I chalked it up to hormone changes from pregnancy but the fact that it never went away even after I had my baby, I realized it had to be something more. Like clockwork, I'd go to the doctor, she'd take a culture, then prescribe me with medication. A week was probably the longest I could keep it away. I was getting so irritated because my doctor seemed to just shrug it off as no big deal but the whole time I'm like, ""this can't be normal"". So I stopped going to the doctor bc I got tired of paying the copay and not getting any better (and it further solidified my skepticism of doctors and their underlying agendas). Eventually the BV went away but for A YEAR AND A HALF, I battled with the yeast. My period would come, then came the yeast. After sex with my husband, yeast. Take a breath--yeast. It was so depressing. Our sex life suffered so much bc I was embarrassed and self conscious about it. I literally tried EVERYTHING....yogurt, probiotics, teas, prescriptions, diet changes, over the counters -- Monistat became part of my weekly shopping list. Then I was doing some research and read about boric acid. I came across these suppositories and figured I had nothing to lose. When I got them, I inserted one suppository at night for a period of just 3 days (and of course at the time, I was in the middle of a yeast infection). I purposely waited at least a month before writing this review because I wanted to really see what the results would be like. It has been over a month and I have not had one trace of yeast or BV, and I have not even had to use any more suppositories beyond the initial 3. I wish I had known about these back in 2015. I would HIGHLY recommend these. It feels so good to feel normal again!"
5,"Great daily watch Another great watch from Seiko. This is my daily since I bought it."
5,"Yes! Fits so many bottles and items. Perfect"
5,"Love my ""Ecozilla""! First...yes, it's big. And heavy. But then, that's why you get a watch like this. If you're not sure about the size of it, then it's probably not for you. The case itself isn't too bad at 48mm, but at 18mm deep, it really stands off your wrist.  The 'Tuna Can' does one thing, and one thing well...it tells the time. No issues with time keeping yet...but would expect +/- a few seconds a year. Ok, it also tells the date, and elapsed time for diving, but, this is not a 'gadget watch'.  It looks fantastic. No picture i've seen of it does it justice. This watch looks good! The black band, the lume, the over-sized hands...it has that ""serious watch"" look.  The Citizen name plus the Eco-drive make this watch worth the price. Throw in the 300m depth, and the giant size of it, and it's just a great watch.  Definitely the biggest watch I've ever owned, but this ""tank on my wrist"" will likely be with me for many, many, many years to come.  If you're a dive watch fan, or a BIG watch fan, you need this watch."
5,"Absolutely love this watch! Orange, really? That was my reaction to this model... the black face looked so mundane and everyday, but the orange face had pop! The price was low so I lulled the trigger. When it arrived, holy poop mu pants! It wa amazing in every way. Hefty and sold, great build, the Seiko chapter marker malalignments that plague the SKX series was non-existent, the oyster band links were very easy to adjust. When I put it on my 7"" wrist, I was concerned it would be too big. Alas, it was not, and it wears quite well. The orange is not obnoxious and when I took it under water it was VERY EASY to read. I have no complaints... love the three year warranty but I took out the Asurian policy for 4 years just to be safe. Well done Seiko, well done!"
5,"SO GREAT OF AN IMPROVEMENT Finally....it comes with a GLASS container not plastic!!!  SO GREAT OF AN IMPROVEMENT !!!!"
5,"Nice quality, comparable to Kay Jewelry version I’m impressed. This is far less expensive, but comparable in appearance, to the significantly more expensive Kay Jewelry necklace with the infinity symbol. They match well and I highly recommend."
5,"Great work out pants Excellent product! Got both the gun metal and blue color. Great fit. Good coverage and nice compression level. Highly recommend"
5,"Great for Spirit! This bag was great and I filled it to capacity and it still fit under the seat on Spirit. See the photo above."
2,"Damaged at delivery The leaf Arrived broken. all the others are lovely."
3,"Gorgeous but Misshapen Okay so I wanted to give it five stars. Honest I really did buuuut, the earrings are misshapen. Gorgeous but misshapen. The two earrings are not even to each other and they one sits odd while wearing. It occasionally just flips over. So I love these earring I just wished they weren’t messed up."
3,"The ear covers kept falling off These headphones were really good for the first few months and have a great mic if you want to use your headphones to make calls. However, after about 3 months of use, the earbud that allows the sound to travel into your ear properly would start to fall off constantly (almost every day). If you're going to buy these, having a case for them would be a smart move so that if it falls off you don't lose it. Unfortunately, one of the ear buds fell off recently again but this time I haven't been able to find it and now I'm at a loss because I can't hear out of the headphone piece on that side. I'm a medical student and use my headphones everyday so now I'm struggling a bit  because I really liked these headphones and can't use them properly anymore."
1,"very uncomfortable still noticeable and uncomfortable"
1,"Junk Bought this microwave a couple years ago and it already went bad. It suddenly overheated and didn’t come back on. You would think a microwave would last longer than a couple years. I would not recommend this unit!"
4,"Almost a great deal! Nice, smooth fabric and vibrant colors (coral &amp; cobalt). You can tell it has a high quantity of spandex. Drapes nicely over your hips &amp; butt. But Medium clings to boobs and gathers at arm junction. Can tell that I will be constantly rearranging  (pulling it down off my upper chest) the top while working out. Disappointed, but I'm sure there's another alternative - Under Armour medium fits fine, but costs more."
4,"Great baggy tee I have a very large chest and I can really appreciate a tee that doesn't cling to it. Nice material and great price point."
5,"Amazing Sound and Best for workout These are light and durable headphones, and stay charged for very long time. I have been mostly using in gym and it stays and don't go loose easily. While playing the song it isolates most of the outside noise. The battery life is excellent and it charges very fast also. The best part of this headphone is the seamless connection it connects instantly and stays connected for longer time and never looses the connection. I would recommend it for outside and gym use."
5,"Is a mouse pad Hey it's a black mouse pad.  Have no idea how this product could have less than 5 star rating.  It would have to take a genius fu@@ up of a manufacturer to screw this type of product up. It works great and I even had to wash it twice....I have boys. Nothing stays clean for long in my house."
5,"Fountain pen users - good for fine/medium nib writing/notes Fountain pen user random review. I have had great luck with this paper - I have literally everything from this paper and 20lb copier paper to ""you name it"" - I have way to much paper (enough to last a lifetime) - many people in this ""hobby"" will totally understand this. Depending on the pen and ink used - the TOPS Gold is good for fine to medium nibs. You can still use it for extra fine, broad, double broad - but except very mixed results. This is my daily use paper, along with 20lb copy paper. I have only one extra fine nib (Sailor 1911L) and it's terrible with this paper, but that probably goes without saying - this paper just isn't smooth enough. Broads, Coarse, Double Broads are usable, just expect feathering, etc. I have ordered this paper in both sizes, multiple times, and it works well for notes, work, etc. If I am looking to do a letter, or anything I am going to keep, I will use higher quality paper/notepad."
5,"Perfectly mounted for open counterspace below This was for my office breakroom and fit perfectly mounted under my upper wall cabinets. Gives the necessary clearance to put and use the counterspace under it and matches our white cabinets . Works just fine and cooks good too. I'm happy with it!"
5,"Great for smoothie making I make a smoothie almost daily and the vitamix is the best blender, hands down, for smoothie making. I put handfuls of frozen fruit and vegetables in the vitamix and the blender easily blends them into a smooth drink. No chunks. No bits of fruit or veggies left over. Pure liquid. I will say that one time my vitamix did overheat because I put too many frozen vegetables in it. However, after thirty minutes it cooled off and is now working fine. The shut off automatic  mechanism in the blender is very helpful if it gets overheated. Overall, I love my vitamix and recommend it to anyone who makes smoothies or juices regularly."
5,"The sound quality was great. <div id=""video-block-R2ITYNDJ8IYYVR"" class=""a-section a-spacing-small a-spacing-top-mini video-block""></div><input type=""hidden"" name="""" value=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/615x9MnXIRS.mp4"" class=""video-url""><input type=""hidden"" name="""" value=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91Ot9FWuawS.png"" class=""video-slate-img-url"">&nbsp;So far, my Mon loves them, they come with different comfort attachments for her ears so her can comfortably fit them along with cancel out the rest of the noise. The sound quality was great. She always wearing it cuz she has a little deaf and she olny use flip phone. It works good on flip phone. But the battery work only for 1 day using."
5,"Comfortable I tried these on after a long day of work; I walk a lot. They were comfortable and supportive"
5,"Tampons These are tampons. They work as intended. I like the applicator, but it is plastic so if you have environmental concerns these are not the ones for you. I normally try to limit my plastic use in general, but find cardboard applicators hurt and I cant use tampons with no applicators."
5,"Great flavor My favorite coffee.  Good flavor. Good price"
5,"smalll😬 it was small, though it would’ve been bigger."
5,"Thoughtful gift idea. She loved. That's what matters most."
5,"Awesome Bag My son uses it for school, he carries a lot of books everyday and this is durable enough to take the weight without getting broken"
5,"my first hoops These were the first set of hoops i have ever bought and i am very happy with them! I love the three shades really make it so you can wear a pair with every outfit. The only thing i was not used to is that sometimes at certain angles they can flip around and be somewhat uncomfortable, that is, until you notice and flip them back around."
2,"Cheap trash I've used this backpack for about 2 weeks. It gets pretty light use. I noticed today that the inside pocket is tearing open completely, and I've never even used it. Poor construction, definitely dont recommend buying."
3,"Solid budget watch for SMALLER wrist. I think it's a SOLID budget level watch.  It's easy to read at a glance, the lumes are 'ok' at this price range.  That being said, since it was one of my first watches, I wasn't sure of what diameter watch I should wear.  Needless to say, 40mm was too small for my wrist.  I still wear it around the house or to bed but if you have large diameter wrist (mine are 8 inches), then the face will be too small IMO."
1,"Was great until the second order! The vendor, not the product is the problem. I had ordered a box of this delicious coffee about 3 months ago. It was great! A few weeks ago, I bought a second box. It tasted funny and a bit on the bitter side. After a few more cups, same problem. I took a closer look at the Use By date and realized the company had sent me an expired box of 84 K-Cup units. How disgusting! I do not recommend nor will buy from this vendor again!"
1,"They leak leak leak and leak some more These bottles leak like crazy, I contact manufacturer and they did not have an opinion about the leakage but offered a sample new product, that leaked also, returned."
4,"These are great nipples for the Enfamil Ready to Use nursette bottles These are great nipples for the Enfamil Ready to Use nursette bottles. However, these are not the same nipples that we were given in the hospital. Our newborn has had difficulty with most newborn nipples being too fast of a flow, with the exception of the Enfamil ready to use bottles and nipples that were used in the hospital. So we purchased these, but found that they were actually much too slow. These actually are not the ones used in the hospital; instead, the hospital uses the standard flow (versus slow flow)."
4,"Great Quality for the Price I tried really hard to love these headphones. Especially because the price point is great, the sound quality is great and the ease of charge is very desirable. However I have small ears and to get these headphones to stay seemed impossible. At most I could get one to stay in and the other would constantly pop out. In all fairness this type of gummy headphone has never worked well for my small ears. I usually get those that sit in front of it. I followed the directions on the card which helped and I even reached out to support. Customer support was great at giving directions and their method seemed to work better but still didn’t seem to work for me. Just not the best fit for me. But it could be for you. Worth the try. Here are the steps they gave me in case you want to try.  Instructions from company:  Hold an earbud with one hand while opening your mouth wide to open up your ear canal. Alternatively, if you have a history of jaw pain, use your free hand to pull your outer ear back and out to the side. This step will open up your ear canal.  Insert the earbud into your ear. Wait five seconds before letting go of your ear or closing your mouth."
4,"Nice quality, cut to fit very snug Nice quality. I ended up returning because I didn’t like it as much as I’d hoped to. It’s cut to fit very snugly, like something to wear to and from the gym if you’re going to be working out in just a sports bra. I decided I wanted something that was cut to fit over a T-shirt and not fit like leggings for the upper body. You could size up, but that’s really not the intention of the jacket, so it looks a little awkward"
5,"Good Product like the copper accent, works well"
5,"Great Value Great buy, my husband is a picky coffee drinker. He really likes the Maxwell House."
5,"Amazing, rubber buds are hard to put on Love these. The buds are magnetic and stick together which is perfect. The only thing is that it is difficult to change out the rubber buds, the trick is to pinch the rubber part when you put it on and it goes on pretty easily."
5,"Scotch Tape works better than the cheap brands I keep a lot of Scotch Tape around for the home office, my office at work, gift wrapping, and various uses around the house.  It's gotten more expensive over the years, so I've tried the cheap brands, and they just don't work.  They look awful and don't stick.  Scotch Tape is as good as its been for the last 50 years or so that I remember it, so I keep buying it.  Because it has gone up in price, I keep my eyes open for a bargain.  This multi-pack on Amazon was priced very reasonably."
5,"Great Quick shipping. Great product"
5,"Absolutely love it. I’m 5’11” 180lbs Absolutely love it. I’m 5’11” 180lbs. After reading the reviews, I bought the 1X. Fits perfect. I wanted something I could wear while doing yard work and chasing kids around. It’s hard for me to find shorts or skirts that aren’t churchy looking and aren’t too short. This is absolutely perfect! Will be buying more."
5,"I love it for every feature it has Its exactly as described. I love it for every feature it has. It looks very stylish and professional. If I had to criticize, I would say its a little too small; but thats explained clearly in the size. Some people may want a slightly bigger bag; but thats just a preference. Very satisfied."
5,"Sweet Watch This is an awesome watch!  The finish is perfect and looks great with the brushed and polished metal parts.  Very simplistic and easy to read.  I wear this thing in the shower all the time and no issues with water getting in the watch.  Water resistant to 200 Meter.  Has a screw down watch back and a screw down crown.  The three hands, hour markers, and 12 o'clock marker on bezel all glow in dark.  The watch face is actually a black sunburst which really adds a cool touch.  The bezel rotates only counter clockwise, it's a 120 click bezel.  Bezel isn't too difficult or too easy to rotate, and definitely doesn't move on its own.  Bezel has a very good audible ratcheting sound and feel when rotating it.  Bezel also has a coin edge so looks good and helps you get a good grip on it.  Strap is very durable, very thick rubber.  Strap is also fairly long, I cut about an inch or so off mine.  Overall, awesome product, great value for the money.  Very affordable and durable dive style watch."
5,"Made for a great gift for a vegetarian teacher We purchased this for my daughter’s teacher for an appreciation gift. Well, it was a hit! She’s always on the go and she’s a vegetarian, so it was the perfect gift without breaking the bank."
5,"Beautifully designed and very functional in Washington state. I love love love this backpack. In love with the design, sturdiness, and functionality. I went with the simpler backpack. Two people I spoke to about Timbuk2 backpacks all love their brand. And they know quality! I haven't worn it in the rain yet, but after wearing it out today in the cold fog to take it out for a trip, and seeing the quality of the fabric and stitching and how they strategically designed it to be waterproof, I have complete trust that my computer will not get wet in the rain. It has just enough pockets for my pens inside, several sections for my business cards and credit cards and a decent size front pocket with loops for me to hook my waterproof foldable grocery bag while I'm out and I love that there's a decent size mesh on the side for a water bottle. The backpack hugs my back and fits perfectly for my small stature (5'5.5"", 93lbs) and it's light to carry and easy to walk with. I find backpacks that bounce while I walk to be extremely annoying. I wish I knew about these back in college. This is my first Timbuk2 purchase and I will definitely be buying more in the future. Even though I'm a fashionista and this has more of a militaristic style, I absolutely love it with my conquest boots and still looks professional and sporty at the same time. I'm super picky and it was hard finding something functional, lightweight, waterproof (not water resistant for Seattle weather), and stylish all at the same time."
5,"Great value brushes for miniature painting I bout these 5 months ago and was thinking of writing a bad review because the number two flat brush barely lasted a few weeks. The bristles frayed and the shaft cracked and fell apart. I was needless to say rather annoyed, but partly because I liked the brush so much. The whole set is rather versatile and I find myself using every brush. The round brushes are good for painting details and all of them can do rather small ones. The flat brushes are great for painting lines (or doing something like a checkerboard pattern) and the large brushes are great for base coats or doing terrain. While the #2 flat died, the rest are all still in good condition and for less than a dollar a brush, these are pretty amazing.  One thing I would reccomend on the small round brushes is that they tend to have a few strands right at the point that aren't strong enough to hold any paint and just kind of tickle the model with errant paint. I just cut the last half milimeter or so off and they work great. I would reccomend this for any warhammer painter- for the price of one Citidel brush, you can get two packs of these."
5,"Great Soup Maker Easy to use and easy to clean."
5,"Why get another one? By far one of the best value for money earbuds you will find out there. If you come across this item, might as well stop your search. You will enjoy these thoroughly, without making a hole in your budget. These are your typical Bluetooth enabled wireless earbuds, with the addition of the microphone, which makes it that much better."
2,"Glass bottle breaks - a caution We have been using these bottles exclusively for our babies for over 2 years and have had at least 6 of them break. What happens is that the bottom falls off and leaves you with a razor-sharp edge. This has happened a number of times while my baby was drinking from it, and a few times when I’ve lifted it out of the warmer."
3,"Good product, wrong price this tonner doesnt work the value brother charges you, be sure to setup the printer to keep printing after the printer says the tonner needs to be replaced otherwise you will lose about 30% of the tonner."
3,"Nice looking but not durable I got this to use for a purse on my trip to Hawaii. It’s a great looking backpack! Unfortunately, not durable. It creates easily, and the inside pocket ripped almost immediately. Also the inside pocket isn’t very well designed. If you put things in it, then it makes it hard to access the main pocket. If it were not so loose it might be better. I would probably have continued using it though, because it is nice looking. However the ripped pocket make it annoying to use. Bummed out!"
1,"Can cause cancer or birth defects!! A product used for utensil/food purposes should not have cancer causing agents. I gave it as a gift and didn’t see any write up about this issue but it was labeled on the gift box.....not cool."
1,"Packing quantity incorrect! Item description and box advertises FOUR bottles, however only THREE bottles fit per box packaging...  I give this a 1 Star because we received 3 bottles and not 4 as advertised and marketed on the product packaging."
4,"Good Value Good value, but kind of cheap feeling. Use only for copies or sketch paper. Obviously, not for resumes, photography prints, or anything like that. I’m also surprised this shipped so cheaply. It’s extremely heavy, so I don’t know how this company makes money on this product."
4,"Works well enough Works well enough.  Seems more powerful than the wattage says, but I also had an old one that it re[placed, so maybe it's good.  Popcorn setting burned the popcorn.  With turn table still food is cold in the middle"
4,"Velcro not good for smaller wrists This would have been a great watch, but if you have a smaller wrist (6 1/4"" or less) the velcro band does not allow you to tighten it enough to keep from slipping on your wrist.  In the past, I bought the Casio men's watch with buckle and have loved them, but I tried this velcro version for the first time and it was too large.  The Casio men's sports watch FT600WB-5BV comes with a buckle!  So I ordered that instead.  https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000GB1RBE/ref=ppx_od_dt_b_asin_title_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1"
5,"Five Stars Great watch, my husband loved this item"
5,"Oh baby Fits just right."
5,"Functional Yet Stylish Functional and stylish for a middle school aged girl."
5,"Can't get enough of these I love these headphones. I lift with them or ride my bike (not always safe, since they are noise cancelling). I love the ability of being able to zone out and listen to music.  They also bring a wire in case your rechargeable battery runs out of juice."
5,"The bracelet looks great with everything you wear and worth so much more than what you pay Love my bracelet, fits just right.Have had so many compliments on the bracelet.It looks great with whatever you wear the bracelet with.Worth so much more than the price paid."
5,"nice small pack we bought this for one of our firefighters little boy that just had surgery, ironed on his and and Maltese cross to personalize it, nice bag for a small child but too small for an adult."
5,"18 Years and going strong I've had this model of Jansport backpack for the past 18 years.  It's my go-to bag.  I've taken it around the world and abused it heavily and it's still going strong.  I just got this bag for my son, as he outgrew his preschool pack.  It's a bit large on him at 6, but he'll grow into it."
5,"Shows off your shoulders Not always in the mood to wear fitted tops so I got some of these.  Here's the rundown...Pretty and cool.  Back is mesh.  Made well."
5,"Bought for school Bought these for my girls in school. They go through earphones quite quickly. Got tired of paying $10 or more a pair. If they break one they have a spare. It has been 2 months so far and havnt had extra pair yet. So durability it ok."
5,"good product！ I always use this brand, cheap and good！"
5,"Good basic dispenser Unlike previous tape dispenser, this one does not seem to be filled with sand to weigh it down.  This is a positive for me, as my previous one constantly leaked sand.  Also, the part that goes in the center of a tape roll is not as easily lost with the design on this one."
5,"Many of them have never seen a Seiko watch like that. I told them where I brought it ... People see the watch and asked me if they can look at it. Many of them have never seen a Seiko watch like that.  I told them where I brought it from and they couldn't believe it.."
5,"High quality materials Love it. First time using a product like this and it performs perfectly."
2,"great deal, but they smell bad I've been wanting to try these leather earrings, and have never purchased any before.  I only opened one of the 16 pairs of earrings.  It had a pretty strong odor to it.  I left them out of the package for a few days and they still smell.  I think I will try to return these."
3,"Nice bag, but needs more laptop padding Update- After using this backpack a couple of months, I have one complaint. While the laptop compartment is well padded around the sides, it has almost NO padding on the bottom. When I put the bag down on a tile floor, I can hear my computer hitting the floor through the fabric. I stuffed an old shirt in the bottom, which helps, but I wish there was padding built in. Beyond that, I am still mostly happy with the bag.  So far, so good. I will try to remember to update my review in a year or so with wear-and-tear feedback. I love it because it is lightweight, but it has plenty of space inside for my things. It also has plenty of padding so it is comfy to wear. What really sold me on this backpack was the rear security pocket, right up against my back, where I can store my passport and money when I am traveling."
1,"Terrible quality. Immediately broke and cracked. Absolutely terrible quality. I opened it to place the stones inside and the lid was barely hanging on at the hinge. I pressed it closed and it wouldn’t stay closed all the way, and the stones nearly fell out. I rearranged them and closed it again and a huge crack formed right on the front opening. I literally held it in my hand for 30 seconds and it broke right in front of my eyes. Terrible!!"
1,"Made very cheaply. I wore the first necklace the day after it was delivered. Within a few hours the bottom tip had completed busted off. I contacted the seller in hopes of just getting a replacement and they never took the time to contact me back. Very low quality."
4,"Very nice pants but... They are described as straight-leg and look somewhat fitted in the picture. I’m 5’4” and 155 lbs.  I would describe they fit as relaxed. The legs were quite a bit wider than I expected or wanted. They are very nice pants if that’s the type of fit you’re looking for. It would be nice if there was a picture of someone wearing each size with the height and weight of the model."
4,"nice fitting and thin I'm basing this review on just trying it on.  I wear Women's 3X and I like my clothes to fit loose, even dry wick clothes.  This fits perfect.  Its thin which is ok with me for my purpose."
5,"Cool earbuds, great fit Good wireless earbuds. Great for the exercise routine. They have been amazing so far. Also, a good charging/storing case in which I can put these safely without losing them. Also, both the earbuds can also be attached to two different devices &amp; have the easy to access control button."
5,"Highly recommend I really like these wipes.  Refresh and moisturize without irritating my skin Note: very sensitive skin"
5,"Great for cleanliness Product has really helped with staying &amp; mantaining fresh!"
5,"Great Just what I needed for a Xmas present fir my mom."
5,"I love this. So stretchy and soft I am long and long arms are important to me. The material is so stretchy that I’d you pull the arms long, then will stay long. It’s so silky and soft. I bought the green then the white after seeing how nice it was. Here’s a pic of th green. It’s the same as the white ."
5,"Five Stars My wife love this ring."
5,"A ‘necessary’ luxury item - so easy and useful! Fantastic product. It’s so simple and easy to use! They provide a cup with a fill line, use distilled water (1 gallon will last you months, so it’s not that big of a deal) and pour into the bottom - then pack it up and turn it on. Once the blue check mark is lit, you’re good to go. Sterilizing takes about 7 minutes and it’s very lightweight. I’ve used this for 7 weeks now (baby is 7 weeks old). I sterilize all Dr. Browns bottle parts, a Haaka, pacifiers, and pump parts. It can hold up to 6 bottles and a bunch of the small items - see photos. This may feel like a luxury item, but it’s SO easy, it’s totally worth the money. Only complaint is that it is very large, but they made it as small as they could while still providing enough room so you don’t need to use it daily. We usually keep it in the pantry along with a gallon of distilled water and only pull it out when we need it, though it looks nice enough that you could leave it out on the counter if you wanted."
5,"Soooo Trendy! If the “in” thing matters to you - buy it. The quality is much better than backpacks a third of its cost and it’s holding up well for my 10 yr old who isn’t all that careful with her things. And, I didn’t know it was the “in” thing until I found myself in the halls of her elementary school during class change. Vera Bradley backpacks were on the back of many, many of the kids at her school."
5,"Perfect Perfect for diaper bag"
5,"Great Backpack and good quality! I bouth this backpack for my son who is going to travel to europe for a month and he need one light and resistant backpack. The quality is very good for the price i paid. Exceeded my expectations!!"
5,"Great size My son loves it and the face is not so large for his arm"
5,"Added bonus - Pockets!!! These joggers were featured in a FB group I follow. They were so cute that for $18 I had to give them a try myself. The packaging was nicer than some of the items shipped from China and delivery was as promised. I think I should have sized down a size because these are baggier in the mid-section than I like. But I do like them well enough to keep them regardless of whether they shrink after washing or not. I’ll just cinch up the drawstring! 😂. I like the material - it’s soft on the inside and the print is really cute. Major plus - there are pockets!!! ✅✅✅ I recommend these camo joggers and can’t wait to see how they can be dressed up or down!"
5,"Great It looks beautiful. The diameter isn't the concern for my small wrist, it's how thick it is  it is a thick watch. But for the sapphire glass crystal and the looks it's well worth the money in the great bargain."
5,"sturdy professional quality sturdy  professional quality. I keep a lot of ring binders for statements , hobbies at home.  this product is perfect for hole punching documents to add to my binders."
2,"This is not a very nice material Feels like wearing a nylon grocery bag and sweat stains are clearly visible"
3,"Showcase derriere but poorly made They made my butt look great paired with butt lifter undies and random squats and probably genetics but the seam came undone after one wear. I received tons of compliments but had to return."
1,"Lining torn Lining already torn. Pack didn't last 30 days."
1,"Indiglo stopped working 3 days after received. 😭 The Indiglo light stopped working 3 days after I received the watch...one of the most important features that I bought this watch for... Come on, Timex...its still ticking, but no light? I'm disappointed 😞  Updated...After 5 days, the watch stopped keeping time. I am completely done with Timex. It no longer is worth considering. Because I trusted in the timex name, I tossed the box, etc., so I am not able to return for refund or replacement...my fault on that...lesson learned. Stay away from Timex, It's crap."
4,"Cook and Blend Food Simultaneously! For a blender that costs just $99, the Instant Pot Ace is an impressive piece of gear. Though I was initially skeptical about the functionality of the hidden heating element, the mushroom soup and tomato bisque I made far exceeded my expectations, and I would be curious to learn how to cook in the blender itself (this is still the most amazing part to me!). The cold blending programs I tested were just as solid, and I especially liked that I could let the blender run unsupervised, walking away to clean up or brush my teeth while my nut milk whirred around. There were some issues with grittiness, especially in my smoothie-making test, but it’s got a lot of power for a $99 blender, certainly more than any other comparably priced blender I’ve ever tried. The blender was only adequate at crushing ice, and there are no manual controls if you want to use the heater without using a preset blending mode.  The Bottom Line The Instant Pot Ace is a useful and affordable appliance to add to your counter-top/ kitchen toy collection!"

4,"Comfortable and stylish Just a little too long. I’m 5’4 1/2. I hemmed the pants myself. Other than the length, Happy with them. Soft, stylish and comfortable."
5,"Perfect backpack for carrying more than you need Great size, awesome material, and looks remarkable. I can’t wait to use it for the upcoming week ahead for classes!"
5,"Five Stars AAA +"
5,"Check register is handy and useful For those of us who still reconcile checkbooks and keep track of checking account transactions, this is a great checkbook register. It was easier to order from amazon.com than make trips to the bank. Price was right also for the convenience."
5,"Good blender! I was a bit skeptical at first, but the blender has been working extremely well.  Pros- Small Lightweight Easy to use Easy to charge  Cons- Does not have much capacity (less than a full 500ml water bottle)"
5,"👍🏻 When you get this type of bottle you do have to take it completely apart to sanitize it and clean it. My Sister likes them."
5,"perfect dress watch Husband is very pleased with this watch.  It is just like the one that was damaged in an accident.  He loves everything about it."
5,"Five Stars Thank you"
5,"Reliable product and price is right. I needed a small microwave that would do everything a standard size does. This is perfect."
5,"Definitely a useful backpack which you can charge your iPhone in a ... Definitely a useful backpack which you can charge your iPhone in a easy way, just need to fully charge the backpack before you using it. I got this for my husband and he is using it now for his trips, these pictures below he just send them to me, said he likes it which match his style. Hahaaaa"
5,"Great Value Bought it for hubby for Father's Day...he loves it!"
5,"Excellent quality Excellent quality will definitely add more to my fall winter wardrobe"
5,"Much improved from Apple's earbuds. I have a lot of inner ear piercings, so most headphones/ear buds are painful after a while. Apple's generic ear buds have always been uncomfortable to me, but after a few minutes with the newer style, my ears would be in a lot of pain. I had to switch to the smallest silicone cover, but these are 100x better. The sound quality is better, the comfort is amazing, and it blocks out a good majority of standard outside noise. I wear ear buds for hours at a time at my job, and so far I have no pain. The magnetic feature was definitely a selling point for me, and it comes with a case and clip so the cord isn't flying everywhere. Very happy with these. The lightning adapter headphone feature was one aspect of switching from a Galaxy to an iPhone that I was dreading, but these are awesome headphones."
5,"Quick &amp; Clean does an amazing job! Wow, we were surprised at how well this cleans our machine!  Been using vinegar, saw this and wanted to try it.  Cleans so much better!  No more vinegar, this stuff is great.  Love the cups.  So convenient. First cup of coffee after cleaning tasted so fresh."
2,"Nice necklace, but broke in 3 months It’s definitely a nice and cute necklace. My girlfriend loved it. However after just wearing it a few days a week the chain/necklace part broke. It didn’t break where the latch was, but a little bit off."
3,"Broke after 1 year. Bought this watch as a cheap watch to wear overseas.  Didn't want to wear anything flashy that would draw attention.  For the past few decades, their Indiglo feature is awesome for nighttime time-checking.  The canvas is a comfortable strap.  The face is simple so it kind of goes with everything.  The reasons I dropped it to 3 stars is even though the band is comfortable, it does seem to attract some dirt/wear.  But I'm nitpicking there.  Also- pay attention to the 1 year warranty with timex and contact them immediately if there are any issues. My watch started getting condensation inside the lens and I ignored it. It stopped working at 1 year and 1 week and they wouldn’t cover it under warranty."
3,"Clear glue review 3 stars because it's good glue and does it's function. -2 because I am buying this to make clear slime and its tinted yellow. It’s pretty frustrating how the clear glue gallons are really poor quality compared to the smaller ones."
1,"If you're looking for disposable earrings, good for a week or 2! I loved these when they first arrived! I've worn them around 5 times in the month since I've received them. The silver color is coming off! !! I guess you do get what you paid for. :/"
1,"wrong sizes!!!! I ordered a YOUTH MEDIUM  in these training pants,  looks like I have received a WOMAN's MEDIUM, I will have my grandaughter try these on,  but they sure look too big.  You will here from me soon.  Thank you, Judith Spaulding"
4,"Not top grade, but solid for most every need Well, okay, they're clasp envelopes, how much is there to review?  In comparison to my previous supply (via Office Depot), these envelopes are slightly less sturdy and have about a half inch shorter lip. The clasp itself is fine. The seams appear of competent strength and seal.  Taken in all, given the non-premium pricing, these are wholly functional, satisfactory envelopes. They won't match your top-grade office supply quality, but they should handle all your normal file and mailing needs."
4,"Four Stars Easy to install"
4,"Good quality, good fit, good price. Cotton bra is so hard to find.  This one is so comfortable, though it is a blend with polyester.  It breathes well enough to do away with the problem I had with yeast infection beneath the breasts. Fruit of the Loom has another one that is front fastening that is 95% cotton.  I have some of those, but the fastener is a little scratchy.  The price and quality of these is wonderful.  I can wear them in a variety of colors and not worry if the straps are showing!  My only complaint is the uniboob issue.  Sure wish someone would make one in this kind of fabric with some separation between the breasts.  I have not had a problem with shrinkage, but then I wash them in mesh bags (so there’s less abrasion on the cotton fabric) and then hang them to dry.  They’re like socks - they stretch while you wear them and then shrink back to normal size when they’re washed - which is exactly what I need them to do.  I have bought much much more expensive bras that are a lot less comfortable and do not wear like these do.  I’ve just bought three new colors to add to my collection.  If Fruit of the Loom makes a bra that is comfortable and separates, I’ll be the first there to buy them!  Meanwhile, these are my everyday bras, and since I seldom dress up, they’re about all I wear."
5,"Great buy! Love it! And, it blends smoothies so well, much better than my old one. You will like it!"
5,"Old-Style Blenders Look Like '50s Relics Compared To This Ninja . . . . Like others who have been using a very old blender for a decade or two, I found this new Ninja one to be absolutely jaw-dropping.  Not only does it come with two large mixing pitchers and two 24-ounce cups for mixing drinks, it also comes with four blades.  The three blades for the pitchers don't have to be screwed in either, so you just lift them out when it's time to scoop out your mixture.  They are not in the way!  Also, you must twist and lock the containers into place, as well as lock the lids, both excellent safety features.  How easy is it to use?  Well, do read the directions and fully understand the Auto IQ Boost feature.  I did not, and ended up turning some cottage cheese that I wanted soupy for my cat into whipped cottage cheese!  Amazing.  I didn't know cottage cheese would whip.  Moreover, my chicken salad turned out to be more suitable for crackers instead of bread, because it ended up as a luscious chicken salad dip, not something you'd use for a sandwich. Try it for your next get-together. (Oh, but make sure you put in more mayonnaise than you should, if you want it to turn out to be a dip.  A lot more.  Like twice as much.)  How easy are all these Ninja parts to clean?  You can either wash everything by hand or put it all in the dishwasher.  If putting in the dishwasher, make sure the Pro Extractor blade comes out totally clean, though.  This is the blade for making drinks that is permanently attached to the drink cup base.  I used the drink cup to make my cottage cheese ""whip"", put it in the dishwasher, and then screwed it back on one of the cups right out of the dishwasher.  The next time I used it, when I screwed off the cup, I noticed a bad odor--the cottage cheese had not been completely washed out of the base grooves.  Thus, I still wash that piece in the dishwasher, but rinse the base and blade with the sink sprayer really well before putting it in the dishwasher.  Thus, there are things to learn with this Ninja, unlike the totally easy-to-use blenders of the past.  The included manual and ""inspiration guide"" both help you to understand everything, and include some recipes.  Unfortunately, nothing that looks particularly good to me.  Nevertheless,  now I know that it does make a difference which ingredients you put in first, and understand the effect of the boost button.  No, I didn't read all the directions before using.  Yes, I should have, but it looked so interesting that I just jumped in and started blending away.  Blending has never been such fun.  And such healthy things that can be made!  (Yeah, sure. :) Where are the chocolate milkshake recipes?"
5,"Transición Buena opción para cambiar el biberón por boquillas así hacen la transición más sueca y aún pueden tomar recostados"
5,"Fits snuggly next to skin under pants for extra warmth. Good for outdoors on really cold days.  A little itchy at first, but fabric softener helped."
5,"Love these I read a lot of the reviews before i bought these and I'm not going to lie, I was worried about getting them but I'm glad i did. My daughter is in love with these! She is 5'3/120 and I got her a size medium and they fit perfectly. She said they're very comfortable, soft and thin. I will definitely be buying more! Hope this helps."
5,"Great bag for students I use this for college and it is a great bag! I love the versatility of the handles/staps. I also like all the sections!"
5,"Prefect size! I love these hoops! I originally purchased a much smaller hoop on accident and I wasn't very happy with it. I'm thankful that I found this larger size as it is exactly what I wanted. It doesn't touch my shoulder, it doesn't feel too heavy, yet it is very visible through my thick black hair. The clasps are solid and seem like they will last for a very long time. I love the fact that these will not tarnish and do not cause me to have any allergic issues with my ears. Love these, recommend these, will be purchasing again!"
5,"Earrings For Any Occassion These earrings are worth the price because you get enough earrings for any event you have! I like that they came in three different colors, which make it easy to match with my outfits. They also came with lots of different backs to the earrings to choose from in case you don't like certain backs. The earrings and backs were separated by color in little bags, which makes it easy to organize them based on their color. I would definitely buy again as a gift!!"
5,"This is by far the best backpack I have ever used I was a little hesitant spending this amount of money on a backpack but I do not regret it at all now!  This is by far the best backpack I have ever used.  The backpack fits very well on my shoulders, does not get sore after wearing it for a while, and I love that it always keeps its form even when empty.  The compartments inside the backpack are very well thought out and I love the side zipper for tablets."
5,"As described It is what it is.  Works well, decent quality, comfotable"
5,"Excellent value I'm wearing the watch and like it very much.  For the price, it's wonderful"
5,"Great Teacher Bag! I love this bag and get so many compliments on it. It fits everything I need and the side pockets are great for easy access. I have noticed the strap coming loose a little from the back and I've only been using it for three weeks so that's a bummer."
5,"Great price Same quality as  jewelery store"
2,"Prints very few pages Runs out VERY quickly.  Didn't even get 15 pages out of cartridge.  Good quality just not much of it."
3,"poor operation This one was sent as a replacement as I thought the first one sent was bad. It wasn’t - the controls on the bud really don’t do anything- volume, switching between phones&amp; music are done on phone. So my first one had nothing wrong with it which was good as it looked like the second was a return. It was defective in sound (stereo cut in and out) &amp; the buds had fingerprints all over them. Returned them &amp; kept original so all seems good. Update - original as bad as replacement- audio shut off when text received. Then volume came back on at max level then shut off. No more. Am returning."

1,"Stitching falling apart, love the bag, sad to have to leave this review. Great looking bag, perfect size, great price.  Falling apart less than 3 months after purchase."
4,"Great for regular pencils; be careful with colored pencils I didn't have #1 or #3 available to try, but for #2 pencils, it does a great job.  I don't feel like I have to be careful not to over sharpen and have the point fall out (this happened a lot with my old sharpener).  Very sharp points! However, I did have to be careful with Crayola brand colored pencils not to push too hard and to not over sharpen.  My first couple of tries, the point fell out.  Now that I have the hang of it, I get a good, sharp point."
4,"Face is unnecessarily big, but very functional I bought this to replace my early 90’s Ironman Triathalon. This seems to have the same functionality, but with a much bigger face and stiffer band. The Indiglo is an improvement. I’m satisfied with the watch, but would buy the 90’s design again in a heartbeat due to form factor."
5,"Buen precio Buen producto"
5,"A very good product These clips seem to work well, hold with no slipping. They seem to be of the same quality that I find in the local office supply store. I am very satisfied with them and would order again."
5,"So roomy! I bought this for my husband because he travels a lot for work. Instead of taking three bags, he now only has to take one! He can fit all his work and travel clothes in this bag along with his laptop and Xbox."
5,"Great backpack My daughter is in college and after her backpack that is nearly five years old finally gave out, I was on a hunt to surprise her with something more sturdy and dependable. After a few hours of comparing different models, I chose this one. The fact that it has the security feature for her to lock up her backpack and the added bonus is all the different storage compartments. This backpack comes loaded with them. The straps are pretty thick and comfortable to wear and the backpack itself feels lightweight before you even start loading it up with all your stuff. I can see this backpack lasting years like the recently retired one has done."
5,"How I packed for 2 weeks for myself and 2 small children in a carry-on bag. PURPOSE: I ordered two of these bags for a family trip last summer.  We went on a two week trip to France to visit friends.  I love efficiency packing, and the challenge of packing for a 2 week trip in only carry on bags is actually my idea of a good time.  Using packing cubes, I was able to do that without an issue.  Had the weather been remotely normal for August in France, I would have been golden...but unseasonably cool temps and lots of rain necessitated purchasing a few more items of warmer clothing for myself and the kids than what you see pictured in the original pack (see photos).  I was able to fit the clothing I purchased there in the bag, so the bag would have accommodated the full requirement of clothing, it was only my initial packing that was inadequate, not the bag itself.  MISSION: EFFICIENCY ACCOMPLISHED I packed a single bag for myself and our two children (ages 3 and 1).  The second bag was my husband's.  Mens clothing always takes up more space, so he needed an entire bag for himself.  I've attached photos of the contents of the bags, as well as how it fits on me.  I'm 5'7"" with a small frame.  I didn't take a photo of my son's clothing before I put it in the cube, but it was comparable to my daughter's kit and also fit in one small packing cube.  I was able to pack 4 small cubes (2 for me and 1 for each child), 3 mesh pencil cases packed with underwear and swimsuits, toiletries and makeup, laundry supplies, a hair towel, 3 pairs of shoes, an extra scarf, belt, travel hair dryer, journal, and travel documents.  I also folded a tote bag into the backpack, and I used this as a go-to bag on the long flight.  Diapering supplies, snacks, and blankets were kept in the storage compartment of a Kelty child-carrier pack.  Since that pack had to be stored overhead, I pulled out my tote bag, took a few supplies from the Kelty pack, and moved them into them into the tote, which fit nicely under the airline seat with easy access to these immediate supplies.  When on the move, we were able to remain hands free.  DETAILS: The versatility of carry options allowed us flexibility as to how we carried the bags and our children.  I cannot tell you the peace of mind that came with truly having everything I might have needed in the cabin with us.  Comfort-wise, this bag is not as comfortable as a true backpacking backpack, but I don't think its reasonable to expect that and to have the flexibility this bag provides as a piece of true luggage.  It's a trade off, and well worth it.  Having hands free on a long trip was a godsend, and the lack of retractable handle-associated hardware really frees up a lot of space inside the bag, in comparison to a roll-aboard style carry-on.  Imagine navigating international airports with two little ones and the associated toileting/diapering/eating...handsfree is a must.  I've also used this bag and filled it up for just myself for 4 day trips to weddings.  In those instances, the focus is less on efficiency and more on having everything I need for different events/activities/+more beauty supplies than I use in my everyday wear.  From reading other reviews, it seems that the company backs its prodcut to the hilt.  I am confident these will get a lot of use in our household, and be durable enough to see our kids through their first ""grown up"" trip across the pond, years down the road."
5,"Perfect Perfect"
5,"Really circulates without having to shake I have used the referb everyday for a month most days twice. No issues so far it will eat ice or frozen fruit as soon as you hit the button I like the blades that pull everything down."
5,"Love this bra! I am a 40K (US Sizing) and have been looking into sports bras in my cup size. I decided to try the Enell Sport, and the first time I wore it, just went on a walk around the neighborhood with my son and husband. I did not realize how much effort I had to put into compensating for chest movement until I didn't have to. For the first time ever, I can do jumping jacks and run without pain. There was still bounce, but it wasn't uncontrolled (which has been the case previously even with wearing multiple sports bras) and wasn't painful or jarring. I can't actually describe in words how freeing it is to be able to exercise without pain from my breasts, shoulders, and back. And the band is glorious. It fits like a dream and there is no chafing under or below the band because of the compression. The only thing that will take some getting used to is that if I wear it for a couple hours and then take it off, there is a bit of pain due to the removal of the compression. (That is not a negative, just something for other buyers to be aware of as it feels VERY odd the first time it happens.) If I could just wear this bra all day every day I would."
5,"Early morning coffee break. I enjoy Eight O' Clock coffee.  I am one of these people who has to have their cup of coffee first thing in the morning.  If I wake up earlier than usual, I immediately, get up, and make myself a cup of coffee via Keurig, and bring it back to the bedroom to drink.  A good cup of coffee helps to make your day."
5,"Oh so comfortable!! I decided to write a review which I don't normally do.  I am a 34 DD and have been so extremely uncomfortable in bras that I was about to just go braless!  I bought these and they are so comfortable and give me a nice round shape, don't flatten me out, they don't dig in anywhere, just great!  If you are busty, hate underwire, still need a little support and want some shape, these are it. I wear them everyday for everything.  I would like if they made exactly these but with a little bit of a racer back."
5,"Great comfort I absolutely love these! I had breast cancer and can't wear underwire as well as I need some padding for the one side. These are so comfortable and work perfectly!"
5,"Immediate growth with side effects Please please get to know about the side effects. It caused severe back pain, so bad it's the worse pain I've ever experienced. On the other hand, my boobs have been significantly bigger. I'd say it is noticably bigger in only under 2 weeks. My mom saw me in bras and said they are so big now! And told me to stop taking these because she's afraid my boobs would be too big and not for my frame. (I'm 92lbs, 5'1)"
5,"Awesome My cup came with a cloth pouch and I didn't think that was good enough to store it in for weeks at a time so I ordered this. It's compactable so you can store easily when not in use"
2,"Doesn't look as good as the picture Looks kind of cheap in real life... Hard to believe this is authentic Gucci..."
3,"small! It's pretty, but far smaller than I would expect for a normal adult woman's wrist. You can adjust the fit but there are not enough crystals then."
3,"Nice style but not accurate Ive been wearing this watch daily for about a month now.The watch is aesthetically pleasing and comfortable to wear. The face is large and relatively easy to read, however this watch loses about 3 minutes every 2 days. I probably would not purchase this watch again due to the accuracy issues."
1,"Waste of money these look as tho they are petite, but not. I can't get them own. much to small. Bad sizing by the vendor.  Waste of money category."
4,"Good buy and easy install if replacing an older version of the same model. So far so good. Had the same microwave model from about 10 years ago and it's still the same dimensions and mounted to same wall plate, making the over-range install super easy. That was appreciated. Notoriously not the best or longest-lasting microwave, but it's inexpensive and not hideous and like I said, I got about 10 years from my original which is a solid run for appliances these days."
4,"My reef flute failed I have spent hours practicing, but what ever tune I play I cannot make the cobra ear buds stand up as they do in the picture. The instructions to make them do that are NOT included. Disappointing! On the bright side, the magnets on the cobras keep them from biting me AND provide some marginal prevention from the sort of coitus that is normally performed by earbuds in one's pocket; intercourse that leaves them so tangled and physically spent that it takes five minutes to uncouple them."
4,"Suprisingly very durable. Well worth it. I work as a first responder, and I constantly am washing my hands, and banging my Watch around. I had a G Shock for a while that stopped working. Though I loved it, and will probably buy a new one, I needed a cheap replacement.  I was expecting this to work for a few weeks, maybe a month. To my suppose, this watch has lasted about a year now. I've swam laps with it, wash and Purell my hands several times daily. I've dropped it multiple times, and I found my dog gnawing on it the other day and the date still works and the clock keeps ticking! Haven't bought another G Shock yet, and at this rate I don't know if I have to.  My only compliant, there is no backlight or any real glow feature to see at night. It's not advertised as such, but I think I got so used to this feature I kinda assumed."
5,"I love these leggings I love these leggings.  I am glad I decided to purchase them even after reading a few negative reviews.  I made sure I bought them in the right size and they fit perfectly.  They aren't too thin and I feel comfortable wearing them on the weekend as jogging pants or with a tunic.  The leggings are extremely comfortable and are not tight at all, but do fit well.  I purchase a pair for my 26 year old daughter and she is in love with them too.  I will share this information with my friends and plan to purchase another pair."
5,"I like the earbuds I have serveral reasons I like the earbuds, firstly, the earbuds are charging in the small case is very portable. Secondly, the earbuds fit me very well. I feel nothing special at all when I am taking them. When I am running, the earbuds never drop which means they are hardly to lost. Thirdly, the sound quality of the earbuds is pretty good. I feel I am absorbed in the music after I pair the bluetooth to my phone. The most but not at least, they are reasonable and affordable price."
5,"Good product Nice product would buy again"
5,"Simple and lovely Perfect and beautiful.  Even slept in them - comfortable"
5,"Fulfills my cute stationary obsession I've been using these for a few days and the colors are beautiful and the thin smooth point is easy to write with and it somehow makes me handwriting look better than it actually is lol. Included the last pic to show bleeding through on my planner- the pages are not excessively thin and are perhaps even on the thicker side so I was a little disappointed to see the color/ writing on the back of the page, however, I cant possibly be mad at these because they are so cute and dainty. Well worth my money and would purchase again if I ever lose them!"
5,"Five Stars Very sturdy"
5,"Gray-Pink Very warm and fits nicely"
5,"Great Gift My wife absolutely loves this necklace. I suprised her with it and it made her day. Now my daughter wants one too."
5,"Beautiful Earrings! These are a bit bigger than stud earrings but that's fine! They sparkle and shine with work or party clothes; they go with anything!  Glad I purchased these and received many compliments."
5,"Makes a FANTASTIC cup of cold brew coffee!!! Great product. Easily cleaned. This French press is super easily cleaned with just a little water and occasionally some soapy water. I haven't taken the metal/handle part off to clean it yet. I mostly just rinse it to reuse again the next day. The screens do screw off easily for taking it all the way apart to get the smaller coffee grounds out of the layers (which I don't get a lot of, but some does sneak in there). I have found that I LOVE the cold brew coffee in this press. Just add coffee grounds and cold water and put it in the refrigerator overnight (you may need to adjust the amount of grounds like we did). Voila! Cold brew coffee for a fraction of what it costs in the stores."
5,"Perfect for hikes I bought each of my teenagers a pack for a big hiking trip. They loved the socks. They were soft, perfect thickness, and really cute too! We were advised to not buy cotton. These did the trick."
5,"Very good quality I really do love this case design. it's both elegant and functional. I can charge the earbuds in it. It has a nice LED display showing the charge level of each earbud and it's visible from outside the case too. The earbuds pair well, they sound amazing and they do a great job of cancelling outside noise so you can hear clearly. Highly recommended!"
5,"Really helpful I have used this already and it served its purpose. I did have to limit the number of pages, as indicated in the description. The holes punched in the same place every time thanks to the page guide. The punched out dots were neatly contained in the bottom and easy to trash."
2,"Another bottle baby won't take I've been on the hunt for months trying to find a bottle my exclusively breastfed baby will take.... I was really hoping this would be the one. But, alas the hunt goes on.  The bottle seems like a good design, my picky eater just won't accept it."
3,"Heavy! This is a very well designed and made product. My issue was how heavy it is -for a fabric suitcase/backpack it is heavy! I opted for the Haynes Eagle one"
1,"Ouch!!!! The this is the worst product you can possibly get. Just go to the doctor."
1,"Horrible quality Two out of the four markers died within a few days despite being completely closed and barely used."
1,"Phillips (Avent) doesn't care about families. I preface this buy saying I spoke to customer service to make sure I understand completely that, indeed, I've been duped.  She helped confirm this.  You can purchase this nip, the rings, and the caps without a problem.  But you CAN NOT purchase new bottles (just the bottom part).  Here's why that's an issue. Baby needed a faster speed than newborn before it was time to go up to the 9 oz bottle (and the medium flow was too fast). So we purchased the slow speed to use with the 5 oz bottles.  All is well until I need to upgrade to the 9 oz bottle 3 weeks later.  I notice I can't purchase the bottle by itself.  Then I look to see if I can buy the bottles with a size 3 nipple (so at least I'm getting ahead of the game).  Not possible.  So, in conclusion, if you are purchasing these to replace your newborn nipples - DON'T.  You are getting ripped off and will just be purchasing a new set with the next bottles.  I told the company I would be switching brands and they didn't care."
4,"Nice product with a minor adjustment needed I love Alex and Ani products but the O ring on this bracelet opened very easily. I still recommend buying - just get the O ring soldered so it won't open up on you."
4,"but most of them have been holding up fine. These have been working well so far...they make life easier by eliminating the need to constantly re-label bottles and food bowls for daycare with ink that washes off after a while. I have noticed some wrinkling with the bigger labels, and some peeling on the smaller labels, but most of them have been holding up fine."
5,"Safe and easy to use Seems very powerful, really like to vortex action. And the multiple speed based on pressure switch."
5,"Fits the bill! I got tired of spending a fortune on teabags, so I have started buying bulk tea and making my own using small coffee filters tied with natural jute twine. I love it! Thank you!"
5,"I used a fine point black permanent marker to write her name (6 ... I purchased the labels for my 2-year-old who was starting preschool for her water bottle, food containers and lids.  I wrote her name with a permanent marker and didn’t wait for the ink to dry; it smeared a little.  My fault for not following the directions.  I used a fine point black permanent marker to write her name (6 letters). I think black is the best color to use and it’s more visible  since the labels are so colorful. Using other colors would blend in and fade easily. The smaller labels are a bit small; her name fits perfectly without the first letter of her last name even though I wrote smaller.  To fit more letters, you can use an extra fine point permanent marker. The larger labels; plenty of room to write a little more.  After more than 6 months with many uses, microwaving, washing with hot water including scrubbing; they are still on.  The adhesive is pretty strong. It’s starting to fade a little.  All I did was rewrote/trace over her name with a black permanent marker.  Besides using the labels for her items; I also stick the labels on my containers and platters that I bring for potlucks.  I will buy more once I’m out and also continue to use them as long the quality remains the same."
5,"Love this bottle maker!! My husband was against buying this because he thought it was a waste of money.  He loved it the minute we got it!  It takes the hassle out of making bottles.  It heats the milk to the perfect temperature.  To my knowledge, it doesn’t have the option to keep the water at room temperature.  It also comes in 2, 4, 6, and 8 oz increments.  We have to pour the extra ounce into his next bottle and put it in the fridge whenever he is in between those (ex: 5 ounces).  Those are my only complaints.  It’s not hard to clean, and it will tell you when you need more water. Make sure to not only clean the dispenser part that comes off, but to clean where the formula comes out and enters into the dispenser.  It will beep after every 4 uses to remind you to clean it.  If you don’t also clean the area where the formula comes out, it will crust over.  I just clean it with a napkin whenever I take the black dispenser part out to clean it.  Make sure to set the dial to the correct level.  Each formula has a corresponding number, and some formulas aren’t compatible.  You can find it online, or you can contact their customer service.  They responded to my Facebook message pretty quickly.  This is a good investment.  We haven’t had any issues with it giving us too much water, not enough formula, etc.  It makes the same amount as when we make the bottles ourselves.  My husband takes this whenever we stay the night anywhere.  He knows it was a good purchase!"
5,"Wonderful shirt I know many people bought this as a tighter fitting shirt to wear under scrubs and such.  I bought it to wear as a kind of loose comfortable shirt that I could sleep in if I needed a little extra warmth without the roughness of a flannel pajama top. I also, HATE anything too tight.  As such, I ordered it one size larger than my normal size and it is simply perfect.  Will order more as it also works great under my sweatshirts while walking the dogs in the cold weather."
5,"Love it! I am very happy with the watch. Thank you Amazon because I would have not been able to afford it without you!!!"
5,"Tall Lady Approved! Soft, comfortable, flattering, and long-leg-friendly. I am 6'0 and medium build with a 34"" inseam and these hit right at the top of my ankle bone--a very satisfactory and versatile length for a legging. The fit is sleek in a good way, hugging curves without being either too-tight and revealing or too- loose and baggy. I have the black color and it is dark and opaque enough to wear a more cropped shirt with if desired. No see-through sections at all. The waist is high, hitting right at my natural waistline. I'm partial to a high waist (and this is the point in the review where I out myself as a mom of 5), but if you want a lower rise these may not be the leggings for you. Overall, I am very happy with these and would consider ordering additional pairs or colors. They replaced a pair of dying big box store leggings and totally blew them out of the water in fit and quality, at the same price point!"
5,"Practical Practical little blind duster. I moisten it and clean my blinds. It's very easy to use, definitely not going to last forever but I'm going to order one more!"
5,"Awesome Watch.... Really built for the task Awesome watch ..if you like a little bit large girthy  Watch,  you'll like this one .  Reason ,I like  this watch because it doesn't get covered by the  sleeve of the shirt . Watch needs solar power ,so it's always exposed to light  and  it is always exposed so I could see it  with the turn of the wrist. I purchased an Apple Watch , it cost me  $700  with the sapphire glass .They are not worth it because they don't have the ruggedness  in the water or knowing your watch is always working without worries  of charging it or  functions are working properly .  Like the Apple Watch  Glitching always."
5,"Perfect Fit I'm 5'4.5"" and weigh 117 lbs. I ordered a size small. The fit was perfect and comfy and the length was just right. Most jeggings are too long even the size small and I end up having to roll the bottom. I am extremely satisfied with the look and fit of this. I will order more in different colors."
5,"Gift for my husband...he likes it... My husband is a bit of a watch addict! But he really likes this one, I say that because I have noticed he wears it a lot even with many other choices.  It's a very attractive watch."
5,"Gorgeous jewelry (&amp; packaging!) The seller is very attentive to detail. I was very impressed with everything, from the packaging to the quality of the jewelry. Would highly recommend!"
5,"Great formula dispenser!!! Makes life easier! I love these dispenser cups. They are very convenient for the diaper bag and at home. They stay closed tight. Yes you have to shake it around to get all the formula out but I don't know of a dispenser you don't have to do that with. I also like that the formula divider comes out later to use for snacks, 2 containers for the price of 1!"
5,"The PERFECT bag!! LOVE this bag!! The perfect size for daily use. Beautifully crafted, authentic and stylish!!!"
2,"Stopped working after 4 weeks After 4 weeks moderate use this broke, it would make the noise but the water would not rise. We tried using vinegar like the instructions suggest, but never had any luck. We even let the vinegar stay in there for days. Save your money and buy a different bottle warmer. This one is not worth it!  They sent us a new one, which is still working! Well for the most part, the timer gets stuck and it will keep warming. We still use it, but set our own timers.  Do yourself a favor and buy a different one."
3,"ok for minor use. not continuous use Can hold too much weight or it will unzip itself. Don't know if i got a bad bag or just bad maker. one the front compartments(pockets) teared and now its one compartment(pocket). It happen about week after using it( keep in mind that I don't open my packages for about a week after they arrive). the overall design is good for personal and business use but I'll be ordering from another brand or seller.  I still use it currently but I need one that fits 17'' laptop along with a tablet. I've got bookbags I have for work use smaller that I've had for 5yrs now."
3,"Three Stars The band feels a bit cheap to me.  The date is a bit hard to read."
1,"Be careful of the seal. Uh... this seal was very black around the rim. Bit gross. I’m returning this."
4,"Mostly good I like that this backpack is roomy and comfortable to wear. I have one minor and one major complaint, though. Minor - I wish it was a little more structured so it wouldn't crumple into a heap when empty. Major - it's not water resistant in the least. If it rains, everything inside will get soaked, and water will pool at the bottom because of the rubber base. If I knew this, I wouldn't buy this backpack. But I won't return it now that I have it. I just have to be careful to wrap my stuff in bags if it's going to rain."
4,"Great 2 in 1 backpack! Perfect bag if you don’t like carrying multiple bags around! It has plenty of storage. I was able to pack 4 waters (with room to spare), snacks, changing pad, diapers, wipes, wallet, and extra set of clothes for my 1yr old. The insulation seemed thick, a bottle of water spilled inside and it did not leak through the bag! The only reason I’m giving it 4 stars is because I did not use ice packs so I do not know how long it keeps waters cold."
4,"Decent to Good Sound Quality, Poor Mic for Voice Calling I bought these for approximately $40. The sound quality is surprisingly pretty decent for the price range. To get the full effect, make sure you have a good 'seal' with the ear piece and the ear. You may need to swap out the rubber pieces. I listen to primarily EDM (bass heavy music). I actually found that there was at times *too* much bass. Shocking I know. For 'standard' music I think most people will be happy with the balance and quality.  However, any calls that are made while connected, while I can hear the caller well, the other person can barely hear me... to the point no one wants to talk to me while I'm using them. Perhaps these are great if you are antisocial, but the rest of us it sucks."
5,"Not much variety Stuff smells okay but only two different scents in the whole variety pack."
5,"Comfortable, good material, wash well. I wanted a bra that had some type of pad for vanity sake, something I could put on easily due to bad discs in neck, scoliosis in upper back and osteoarthritis in every joint and bone you can think of, so, pain was a big factor in deciding how to accomplish putting on a bra. I like wearing the razor back tops, and I can use this for Norman tops as long as the neck opening is not too wide. They are plenty soft and comfortable for me. I can easily zip them. I ordered size using their chart. .  Buying more !"
5,"Durable and roomy! Well made and durable.  It holds my 17” laptop and several heavy textbooks for college classes."
5,"Elegant and comfortable A great pair of pants. Look elegant, feel comfy."
5,"Beautiful earrings These are beautiful. I just wish the backs didn’t fall off so easily. I put them on my daughter and in 24 hours both had fallen off. We lost one of them and can no longer wear them. :("
5,"consistent , reliable, reasonable, quality.  What more could you ask for. I’ve used this almost a year now, simple to use great cup of coffee everytime.  I’m sorry I didn’t star sooner, I didn’t know coffee wasn’t suppose to taste bitter, curse you k-cups.  If you grind your own beans it takes you up to higher level of coffee quality with this.  Good beans, good grinder, good press can only lead to awsomenesssssss."
5,"Supportive This is the third playtex bra i have purchased in the last few weeks. I dont know why i didn't try this brand sooner. This bra is very, very supportive, it is true to size, and it is very kind and generous in the comfort department. It is very breathable as well. I wore it yesterday as i did yard work outside on a rare hot day here in Northern California, and it wicked away moisture better than any sports bra i own. This bra is utilitarian which i love, for example, i  can wear it to the gym im the AM, wash it out in the sink, then wear it under a pretty dress for  the evening. I even wear it to sleep in, as i am one of the unusual women who likes to wear a bra to sleep in as well. I love this style, i would recommend it, and i will order a few more in the future! :)"
5,"Comparative review of five Balega sock models I have a number of pairs of Balega socks which I've worn for running, and the Soft Tread is my favorite overall. Here's a few comparative thoughts.  I've bought five different types of Balega socks in total:  Balega Soft Tread No Show (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Balega-Soft-Tread-No-Show-Royal-BAL8926/dp/B007Q3QP4Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Balega Soft Tread No Show - Royal BAL8926</a>) Balega Ultralight No Show (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Balega-Ultralight-No-Show-Socks-Royal-Blue-White-Small/dp/B00U1VWNVC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Balega Ultralight No Show Socks - Royal Blue/White - Small</a>) Balega Hidden Contour (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Balega-Hidden-Contour-Socks-Black-Yellow-Large/dp/B00LPSN88W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Balega Hidden Contour Socks, Black/Yellow, Large</a>) Balega Hidden Comfort -- THIS PRODUCT Balega Blister Resist No Show (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Balega-Blister-Resist-No-Show-Socks-White-Large/dp/B00B9IOQ3O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Balega Blister Resist No Show Socks, White, Large</a>)  The Balega Ultralight are very thin and rather smaller--especially in comparison to the other models. I've bought size Large in every sock, and they vary quite a bit. (For reference, I normally wear a men's 10, though I wear 11s for running.) If you like thin small socks, you may like the ultralight. Or go a size big if you want them to fit more comfortably.  On the other hand, the Blister Resist were way too thick and large. They had so much excess material that they felt horrible and my feet moved around in them. They are very hot. The material on the top of the foot is actually very thin, but the bottom makes up for it. That said, They make a comfortable sock to walk around in on my wood floors in the winter. Since I won't run in them, I give them use around the house.  The Hidden Contour and Hidden Comfort are similar. The Hidden Comfort are a tad thicker. They are both a bit thicker and larger than the Soft Tread socks, but they are comfortable and nicer for winter weather, when I tend to wear them running. If I were buying more, I'd go for the Hidden Comfort. Mine have stayed superbly comfortable longer than the Hidden Contour and still feel more padded.  I like the Soft Tread best (for running) because they are thick enough to be padded and comfortable, but I have to pull them snug on my feet so there is no room for my feet to move against the sock. Also, they are not so thick that I feel my feet get hot -- and I run in 100 degree Texas summer weather. Finally, the Soft Tread are made R and L foot specific, which I've found to be helpful for fit. The Ultralights are as well, but not the other three models, if I recall correctly. Though the Hidden Comfort came with an L on each sock, that stands for ""Large"", not ""Left"". Also, the heel tabs on a lot of these sock models, including this one, are great and do a lot to make sure the sock stays in place.  Hopefully this review helps a few folks decide what Balega sock might be best for them if they're looking to purchase. If you have questions, comment and I'll try to answer them."
5,"Excellent Excellent bag ever I love and I recommend it"
5,"She Loves It! Several years ago my wife said that she would be interested in trying the Diva Cup.  We don't have any kids and we aren't going to so as a tongue-in-cheek joke, I got her the model 1 Diva Cup for Mother's Day.  She was excited!  She said there was a little learning curve in order to remove it, but once you get the hang of it, it's no problem.  She likes that she doesn't have to mess with (or spend money on) tampons and pads."
5,"Awesome - better than expected! Since I relied 100% on people's reviews to help me pick these out, I figured I would thank you all by paying it forward! I was nervous to buy these online without trying them on, mainly because I was worried about getting the wrong size and/or having my butt stick out too much! I am 5'7"", 128 lbs, waist 26, hips 36. Usually wear size 5 dress and size 7 jeans. I found the mediums to be absolutely perfect! The fit is really nice, they are very short, but still have enough material to cover my rear. I haven't done any super high level activity in them yet, but I moved around to test them out and had no probs with them riding up. I read some reviews that say they're too short and sheer to be worn alone, but I totally disagree...would wear them alone anytime (although I did buy the black ones, so maybe lighter colors would be more sheer?) Really cute and totally worth $11...I'll def. be buying more in different colors : )"
5,"Envelopes I just used the first one yesterday as for adhesive seal it seems to work great and as for envelopes I can't say much more.  They work well for envelopes."
5,"Awesome,but needs pockets Only downside is no pockets, but I knew that going in to this."
2,"Plastic Accessories Did not last  Purchased 14mos ago. Hard Pass Okay. So I have a total of three Immersion Blenders. A Breville brand, A All-Clad brand and I HAD a Braun Brand ( The one pictured here.) I was attracted to it because I was also looking for a light food processor. I have a heavy duty one, but I wanted on for quick chopping.  My Breville one is still going but it is not as efficient as it used to be- but I still use it to make my homemade butter. My All-Clad is a workhorse and I use it for EVERYTHING.  Now this piece of garbage Braun. All of the attachments- including the wand is made of plastic, except for the blade (of course) and  I had it for about 14 months using it daily but for veggies and light recipes.  One day, I went to use it for a quick blitz and it was making a weird noise. I was baffled because it was relatively new, in relation to my other two blenders. So, I looked at it and found that the inner connecting component(the part that all of the attachments connect to was warped and broken!  It is entirely useless all of the accessories are rendered void! Don't buy, please. If this product cannot last after a year of light use, it is not worth the money or space.  I never use d this thing to process butter!!! Try a Breville or All-Clad. I have had these two for (5)  and (4) years respectively."
3,"Not like the store I was expecting the same I get in a box I buy at the store. They were packaged differently, shaped different and the stickiness is annoying. You pull the paper off n the stickiness transfers to your hand. The pad doesn’t stay on as well as the ones I bought at the store. Won’t buy again online."
1,"I'll easily promote the stars but right now I can't find ... I ordered this in October 2015; normal use of daily shake. Today the blade broke in half. If I can replace the attachment, I'll easily promote the stars but right now I can't find how to do a replacement for the attachment. **Picture of the split blade attached."
1,"Disappointing I'm a huge fan of jansport, it has always been my preferred brand of back pack since 93'. The pack is from heavy and not the typical jansport quality. It keeps flipping over and the wheels are loud. The sleeve for the laptop is in the middle of the pack. I have a 15 inch mac and the bag saga down and the front of the bag hang over the bottom. The mac swings back and forth unstable if you don't have anything in the bag to support it. Very disappointing."
1,"Cheaply built.  Spend a few extra dollars for a much better product. I bought this after the glass on my last press broke (used for about a year). The lower price and the copper look is what made me decide to purchase this particular French press. After about 1.5 weeks of daily use, the handle fell off as I was about to pour. Luckily, I caught it and the glass didn't break. The screw holding the handle is very very cheap. The threads are corroded and don't provide any clamping, so the handle is useless now. Thankfully, I still have the frame and handle from my previous press that I can use the glass with. My previous one is a Bodum, which I'd highly recommend over this poorly built product."
4,"Good coffee Great flavor but a little weak eventhough I got medium roast. If you like strong get darker roast."
4,"extremely durable, great pockets I'm a female in blue collar, these are my work pants.  Although many other girls have no issue with it, personally I don't feel my skinny jeans are ideal for the work we do.  I sweat easily and I don't like when my jeans stick to me so I tried these.  Pros:  1) Pockets are awesome, when I'm working with limited amount of places to rest my tools (we don't use tool belts), I just put it in my pockets (I love the diagonal back pocket design for my shorter tools).  2) Super durable, haven't put a hole in them yet, and when everyone elses jeans are getting eaten by the acid we use, these treat it like water.  3) Water repellent and quick drying. Cons:  1) Unless a breeze is blowing up the pant leg, these can get kind of hot and are pretty wind resistent (so this might be a pro if you're in a cold climate).  2) They don't have much stretch.  3) Size; this style runs larger than the other 5.11 styles in my opinion but only goes down to a 2, while the other styles go down to a 0.  So in my case, I can fit the Stryke 0 but I prefer the Stryke 2 for work comfort, and the Taclite Pro 2 is a bit loose without any weight in my pockets.  Considering it has a partial elastic waistband, it does ride even lower if I have a lot in my pockets and have to walk around, but not usually a problem if i remain stationary.  However when crawling headfirst through tight spaces, if my pants get partially stuck on something, I have to ""unstick"" it instead of just powering through or it will pull it down.  Overall, the pros outweigh the cons for me and I wear these everyday."
4,"Four Stars works really well."
5,"Five Stars I love my bracelet.  My favorite animal is the elefant. Beautiful!!"
5,"Comfortable socks Perfect fit very comfortable"

5,"Makes great butternut squash soup and shakes!! Love this!!! I’ve made some great shakes with it. It has so many great uses it’s going to take a while to learn them all. I’m excited about the hot function to make soups. There is a great recipe for butternut squash soup that a friend of mine found that we tried and it’s delicious. It was super easy. This really grinds down nicely to a purée for the right texture for the soup. I’m really happy with this and it’s a great value!!!"
5,"Very nice I use convention all the time My wife said she wouldn't use it  Well 3 days later guess what. Very nice I use convention all the time. I'm the master in cooking and this is the guy"
5,"Perfect for soccer! My teenage daughter LOVES these pants.  They are nice and slim fitting without being as tight as leggings.  She can put them on over her shorts--even with shoes on--since they have zippers at the bottom."
5,"This was exactly what I expected and wanted. No ... This was exactly what I expected and wanted.  No frills packaging and strong flavorful coffee.  Comes in a nondescript box, the cups were all intact and none of them had any punctures or dents.  The price is what coffee should cost and I will never go back to buying any other brand."
5,"Five Stars this smelled soooooo good gotta buy more"
5,"Love it Bought this for my daughter's 2nd Mother's day, she is living 2 hours away and I miss her terribly along with my granddaughter. She loves it as do I and with wearing it she will always be reminded that no matter how far apart we are we will always be together!"
5,"Necklace What a wonderful looking piece jewelry it’s appearance make it look More  expensive than is very happy with it bought for my wife"
5,"Good standard index cards for a great deal! Crazy good deal compared to buying individual packs! These will last me darn near forever and I have enjoyed this product from day one! Somewhat thinner cards but they are quite standard."
5,"GREAT PRODUCT GREAT PRODUCT"
5,"Make sure you clean your keurig! These make cleaning my machine regularly quite easy - just run a normal cup through, then again to rinse. Keeps the machine running top notch without build up or other grossness."
2,"Not the version I saw in Best Buy, not happy, but serviceable Saw the Legend IQ in Best Buy and saw that Amazon had a lower price, so I ordered it on here. Needless to say, I'm disappointed, but for the most part, it's serviceable until I find something better.  It's nothing like the model in the store. Just a few warnings. This model is supposed to be old. It's definitely not as good as the version I saw in Best Buy. Also, I'm a bit concerned at how old this model is, because whatever is supposed to be the cellphone holder does not hold any modern cellphone popularized after the Iphone came out. IT'S ACTUALLY MEANT FOR AN OLD SCHOOL IPOD! So it's basically useless. But I'm not a teenager that needs to always listen to music and there's bluetooth anyways, so it's not a problem. There's also no strap for your carryon like what was shown in Best Buy.  The sunglass holders also will not hold a case of any size. Not happy about that either.  The drink holders also don't have the webbing that the model in Best Buy has. Drinks I've tested with it seem to fit snugly, so I guess that's not an issue.  Kind of disappointed with Amazon and their QC. People are getting all kinds of different models of the same bag on here and that's messed up. Some guy thinks he got the wrong bag when he actually got the one I expected from Best Buy! Come on now, what a joke.  Definitely will reconsider buying from here in the future. Get rid of all these dodgy sellers and guarantee your own product is what you say it is or I'll go somewhere else."
3,"Not as good as I hoped Love Peet’s coffee, but these aren’t that great. I wanted to like them but for the price I’m going to stay with Nespresso. It’s odd, really, that non-brand capsules can’t be better in the US. Last year on vacation on a French island in the Caribbean, the house had a Citiz machine, which we all loved, but we had no Nespreso capsules, they just used the ones from the French grocery store. They worked fine and were delicious enough that we all bought a Citiz machine upon return! (Even though I already had a Vertuoline machine.) so I’m keep trying these other capsules, hoping. But Peet’s are same price and to my taste, kind of weak and off tasting. How do the French do it?!"
3,"Crown was faulty I'm someone who isnt able to wear quartz watches unfortunately. Something about my body chemistry drains the batteries on quartz watches within days of having them.  I read on a forum that this might be able to be remedied by using a NATO strap. I liked the look of this watch, and it came with a real leather nato strap.  When I got the watch, the second hand did not line up with the actual seconds on the face of the watch, which is a minor annoyance to me. This watch has a loud audible tick that youll hear in quiet environments.  Ive really enjoyed it, up until the point that i picked it up and it was no longer ticking. Looking closer at it however, it was still attempting to tick, but was actually stuck. Pulling out the crown, and adjusting allowed it to tick again, before becoming stuck several times.  I unstuck it recently, and its continued ticking, however it wasnt keeping accurate time any longer, gaining about 5 mins in a 12 hour period.  the indiglow feature is now also not functioning.   Ordering a replacement under warranty. If it happens again, I'll sum it up to it being a quarts watch. If it doesn't, ill be happy and keep wearing it and add more quartz pieces to my collection, on nato bands. 3/5 due to the first watch being faulty."
1,"Stopped working Well I bought it in November 2016 and it short circuted and stopped working in June. I am pretty upset. Ive never had a microwave do that. I have had even cheaper microwaves last for years."
1,"Wouldn’t recommend for newborn Nipple collapses when baby eats. Has a faster flow than most other slow flow nipples."
4,"Perfect Replacement for Label Printer Tape Bought this as a replacement for my label printer. The pack of 4 cartridges are certainly value for money. As there are a lot of wires that need to be labeled in the house, these tapes will surely ensure I don't run out of tape for labeling. The tapes are as expected. My only wish would be for the sheet at the back (the sticky part) to be easy to remove. Right now, it takes some time to get it off. No complaints with the quality though. Would recommend this product to anyone who has a Brother Label Printer."
4,"Very Big These sticky notes are very BIG. I know the description line indicated 4x6, but I was expecting something a little smaller. The picture does not accurately represent the size. The advertising picture made it seem like it was be a moderate medium size, but nevertheless I still utilize them when taking notes in class or making to-do list at work."
5,"Really helps I really like this disease. The only drawback of this bottle is that there are some parts to clean. But it's not so bad because I use the dishwasher well. They say you can use it without green inserts. But if we do that, we have a problem with leakage."
5,"Bling bag Perfect Bling bags for my kids.  They love selling little girl jewelry!"
5,"Perfect colors! Perfect fit! Perfect price! I have several pairs of Saucony sneakers and while I didn't necessarily need Saucony socks, I thought 'why not match?' I found these socks in several different color options and there was the option to buy an eight pack or 16 pack and with the price being what it was, I chose the 16 pack (it ended up being $1.56/pair). I absolutely love these socks. I washed them immediately and I love the way they feel and the way they fit. I wear a size 9 sneaker and I will say these socks fit much better after they're washed (for those who are wondering). This socks are thinner on the top of your foot than they are on the bottom. The bottom has a little bit of extra cushioning. There is also a little bit of tightness around the arch of your foot, which I personally like. On the back of these socks at the top of your Achilles, there is a bit of a tab which will likely stick out from a low sneaker... But that also means your sock will absolutely not fall down into your sneaker at any time. I absolutely give these socks a 5 star rating and I highly recommend them. They are soft, comfortable and good for anything from heavy athletics to just relaxing days running errands. The color options vary so make sure you check before you make a final decision.  Thanks again Amazon!!"
5,"Five Stars Great"
5,"Absolutely the BEST travel bag I originally bought this bag because I needed a carry on that could hold enough clothing for my 3 year old and myself during a 30 h layover in Istanbul where we planned on exploring the city. We were coming from a different country with much colder weather so we had to pack completely different clothing for our stayover. This bag was perfect for it. Since that trip, we've used it for 3 days in Colorado, 3 days in Chicago, and 1 day in Budapest. Typically, carrying around a bag this size and trying to wrangle an active toddler is akin to a waking nightmare, but this bag really makes it manageable. 10/10, absolutely recommend."
5,"It’s Everything as Advertised If you need a traveling backpack, buy it.  It’s great!"

5,"Couple bracelet My boyfriend loved it. I gifted him in our 2nd anniversary and he was so happy. The bracelet is very strong and shiny. One of the best thing to be gifted."
5,"Solid Sound Quality - Avoid Misleading Reviews I very rarely write reviews, but felt their were some patently misleading posts here about sound quality.  I have multiple headphones including jaybird x3, and jabra 65t and wanted a daily workout pair. I’ve only had these for 36 hours but the audio quality is good and seal/fit is also good. No able to comment for sure on battery life, and pairing with IPhone X was annoying. That said:  For $45 these are a steal and wondering if some of these reviews are expecting these to be the quality of a $100 headphone?"
5,"Rich Flavor! I'm very picky about my coffee, this is amazing! I love the whole bean, we grind it every morning and do pour over coffee using the bodum pour over coffee maker. It has such great rich flavor. My only complaint is the price, we were doing subscribe and save but either it won't be in stock or the price is much higher than our local grocery store."
2,"Not made well. They look very nice, but they lose the stones very easily, even just grabbing to take out of the package.  The stones are very loose in the prongs.  Even when putting an earring on, just holding the front to put the back on I have had them fall out.  Very disappointed.  The colors are very nice, price was not bad, but not doing any good if we have to throw them away after losing the stones."
3,"Ugh Irritated! Bought this as a gift and expected it to come in a cute little gift box as shown in the photos and reviews. It arrives today in an brown envelope. I open it and it’s in a grungy, sticky package. I’m not happy"
1,"Chunky Lemon Pure Leaf I've been a faithful customer of Pure Leaf for quite some time. However, the latest case of tea that I received went bad way before the date on the bottle. It got chunky, and I'm assuming just spoiled. I cancelled my recurring order and ditched my Dash button. Will not be purchasing again."
1,"Don't buy this Horrible!! I am on my 4th KitchenAid mixer so I bought this item expecting the same performance, not the case. I got it today and simply wanted to purred roasted butternut squash for soup, the bottom attachment came loose from the motor 11 times in 4 minutes. I checked and checked, it was put together exactly as it's supposed to be. This thing is a mess! I'm wondering if it's really a KitchenAid or some Chinese piece of crap."
4,"Have only been taking it for a short while, ... Have only been taking it for a short while, but it seems to help and I am going to stick with for more positive results!"
4,"Nice BUT Very nice gift, except the words daughters and never don't have a space between them. Just one word."
4,"Love it! Very comfortable and the purple is gorgeous. Buy at least one size up (like all the other reviews say). 2 sizes up if you want a more relaxed fit."
5,"Long pad I bought these for my girlfriend and she says theyre perfect for sleeping. The pads are thin but long so she's confident they won't leak."
5,"Daughter loves these Part of her workout gear for track."
5,"Granddaughter loves this My 4 year old granddaughter loves this. When she is at home she puts toys in it to pull them around. The case has held up well and its been used almost everyday. Great for sleepovers at nana's house!"
5,"Great product We have two of these that 120 employees use every day.  They work perfectly.  We have one that they have for who knows how many years, as I have been with the company for 6 and it was there when I got there."
5,"Five Stars Works as expected! I always keep them on hand for vacations or other emergencies."
5,"Beautiful watch Got this for my boyfriend for his birthday. I did a little bit of research using Reddit's /r/watches subreddit and they recommend this watch for the $300 - $500 tier. This watch definitely has more value than it's price. It's elegant, has 1 complication (the date), and is mechanical, featuring a beautiful sapphire window at the back.  It is annoying that you have to change the date, but you never have to worry about changing a battery (since it's mechanical, meaning it's powered by the swinging of your wrist). A lovely watch and elegant design. I highly recommend this particular model."
5,"Great fit, ran true to size. I usually wear a size 7 in jeans so when I read the reviews saying the pants run a little small, I ordered them in an 8 regular.  I could have easily gotten them in a 7 as I have about three inches of room in the waist.  Im going to keep them though, as my belt and equipment will take up a little of the extra space.  I love the fabric, its not extremely heavy and that is a big thing when I live in the desert and the summers are well into the 100\s.  Reviews also stated that some were finding the legs to be tight, I found the legs to be very roomy.  The length is good for me, if anything maybe just a half inch longer than I usually wear, at 5' 6"" I am usually in between that regular and ""short"" size, but these cover the tops of my boots without hitting the floor in the back. All in all I found these to be great pants for my work.  Its great to have something that actually fits a womans body.  Finally I can look like a female when I go to work.  Great product, well worth the cost, shipping was fast,"
5,"Best pad hands down! The best pad hands down!!"
5,"Good small, light watch Yes, it's small.  It looks ok on my 6.5 inch wrist, but, it looks small compared to the large watches most people wear today.  That said, I bought this to have a small watch that I hardly notice I'm wearing and it's perfect in that sense.  The small crown at 4 o'clock is nice too - it makes it more comfortable to wear.  It took about a week for the strap to break in and become comfortable.  When I received it, the watch was consistently 15 seconds fast per day.  I opened it and _carefully_ adjusted the speed (see youtube) and it's now about 5 seconds fast per day; not bad."
5,"Really cute, but small This is a great product for a child. My granddaughter is 9 and needs hypoallergenic earrings. They fit perfectly on her small ears and she did not have any allergic reaction She loved them and they seem to be of nice quality. They came packaged in a nice box. Would definitely purchase them again."
5,"Satisfied! Great fit!"
5,"Cool grandpa watch looks like modern retro accessory Needed a new basic watch with day/date for work- I am a nurse practitioner and wanted an easy-to-read model. I am very sensitive to metals/nickel and have had no problems with this watch. This watch is totally cool. It's like a bangle bracelet since it has a men's size band. No clasps. Just stretch links. (I think it can be easily adjusted by a jeweler) Honestly it looks like an expensive retro-style watch. The face illuminates when you press the dial button. It was a little frustrating to set initially since I had to wind through a few days to get the day/date right. But- I love this watch so far.  Much classier than my plastic Swatch (RIP)."
5,"Wow, such a wonderful product! It is really strong and good in quality. Many compartments and very useful for international travelling(which I usually do)"
2,"Two Stars Nice looking but a lot smaller than I pictured! Hard to read the inscription!"
3,"Runs small If you are between sizes and want it to fit like the model go a size bigger. I'm usually between a medium and large usually more a medium so I ordered a medium and is a bit tight."
3,"Need to size up for more athletic builds This is not only close-fitting, but it's a thicker material and could be called compression fit.  I typically wear an M, but ordered an L to ensure a looser fit.  It's tight fitting and restrictive, so I knew I wouldn't like it for skiing.  I gave it to my daughter who typically wears an XS and S, so the L fit her lose enough so the restriction doesn't matter.  The inside fleece liner is nice so it will be warm.  Update:  The company responded to my feedback and sent me a larger size for free - amazing service!  I loved it for skiing!  It's still a thicker material, but was fine when looser.  Just beware to size up if you're a more athletic build or larger chested.  Again, I typically wear a size M in normal clothes and sometimes an L in athletic wear.  I had to go up to an XL in this style for it not to feel tight on my arms."
1,"Not for medium sized feet - small feet only. Hate them, they are too short and fall off of my heal. :("
1,"LG service the worst The microwave is okay but does show finger prints something awful.  The programmed functions have numbers rather than plain English titles -- not"" frozen veg"" like Panasonic but ""3"".  Stupid design mistake.  However, mine quit working and despite multiple contacts -- supplying the same information over and over -- still not action.  My old microwave stopped and I went out and bought a new one within days because I didn't want to be without.  Now I have been waiting nearly 3 month for LG to make good on their warranty obligations.  The poor service put LG out of the running when I purchased a new TV!"
4,"Can’t get quiet, blink constantly, annoying notifications Sound quality is good for the price, they stay in my ears very well and get quite loud. The problem is on the software side of things. I can’t stand how they constantly blink when in use. I wear them during the night and it looks like lightning in the room, the leds are also just too bright. Another problem, arguably more significant, is the low battery notification. It first starts talking over music about low battery up at 20%, and continues until it actually dies. The last complaint I have is they don’t get quiet, the largest problem. They do get very loud and sound nice, but iPhone volume notches 1-4 sound almost the exact same, not very good for sleep. These obviously aren’t complete dealbreakers but they could be easily fixed with some sort of update or new release."
4,"Nice and cheap For the money, I can't complain. It stays on my waist but is relatively loose. Very comfortable, holds up to washing, warm. The only thing I don't like is that the ankles have elastic, which normally is fine but because it's on the looser side it slips down under my feet which is annoying. Again, for what I spent I am fine with what I got. They're comfy pants."
5,"Great for small kitchen items Just what I was looking for. An adequately sized dishwasher box for small kitchen items that have no safe/fixed spot in the dishwasher. Though it is very well designed especially for baby bottles and related accessories, it works very well for blender parts and other small dishwasher-safe kitchen items that otherwise get lost or fall through the dishwasher racks. Very happy with this item."
5,"Excellent Excellent little microwave. There is just the two of us and this little 750 watt baby does an excellent job."
5,"Great value! I can't see any reason to spend more for a backpack that will be used for one or two night trips, for hauling stuff to and from the office, or for school. I can carry my laptop, kindle, pens &amp; notebook, toiletries, and a couple of days worth of shirts/undies/socks for casual travel (or for overnight rather than hauling a suitcase into a motel). It also functions well as a carry-on.It's well made &amp; tough. All of the seams are intact, all of the zippers zip/unzip, all of the clips clip, etc. on mine after almost two years of use. My only caveat would be the claim that it fits 17"" laptops. The dimensions of my Toshiba laptop are 10 1/4"" x 15"" (15.6"" screen) and it's a snug fit. The claim that it fits 17"" may be overly optimistic. That being said, the laptop compartment is well padded and the velcro strap does a good job of securing my laptop. My son also has one that he uses for school and is very happy with it."
5,"Good value for money The noises cancellation is very good, the sound quality is perfect, you can feel the bass very clearly and deeply. The volume of the headphones is very good too, it is not too high or too low, matches perfectly with the device you are using with. The distance from the device that the earphones accept is 33 feet and is very good as you don’t need to be so close to the device as with the normal earphones. You also can answer, hand up and reject calls depending on the pressing of the buttons in the headphones. The battery life is very good, it lasts at least 10 hours continuously. I really liked it, it is an excellent product and I recommend it if you enjoy listening to music."
5,"World of Difference I am so thankful to have come across this! I am very sensitive to antibiotics and just overall deal with odors due to BV occurances no matter what I would do! I use special washes, probiotics, nothing seemed to help. THIS though! I did a 6 night treatment and what a world of difference! I plan to do a one night weekly or bi weekly treatment for upkeep but I didn't do anything for two weeks or so after my 6 nights, and also had a period and still didn't have an odor issue! I wish I found this sooner!"
5,"Really nice &amp; useful ! We bought for my daughter because she had a college tour for 5 days. It takes a lots of the things. My daughter really likes it!"
5,"Comfortable and durable My husband has been using these for the past two weeks for work and he is loving them. He can easily call me and not have to use his hands well working. I was able to clearly hear him well we talked which was a major plus. My husband mainly uses these to listen to music well he's working. The quality is amazing. The sound is perfect he says and they fit his ears comfortably. He loves that he can also safely store them in the case they came in. Would definitely recommend this product and already have."
5,"MY SON LOVES THEM!! My son really wanted airpods but his parents thought that they were a waste of money so I bought them for him behind their back and he loves them!! He has wanted them for a while now and these are really good quality!! Real things!! He wore them all day long!! Glad he's thankful!! God Bless, Margaret (Michael's mother)"
5,"Great deal for the size Great microwave. It’s rather large but it works wonderfully."
5,"Very good good Thank you very nice it great as its good good good good good good good good good good good good quality"
5,"love this bag! I've had great luck with this bag! We use the Doctor Brown's bottles. While the product details say that this bag holds two bottles, I regularly have 3 in it with no issues. 4 if you find creative ways to place the ice pack!  We've taken this bag everywhere... Parks, restaurants, beach, shopping, etc. It has a nice look, but it also easily fits in our diaper bag. I'm debating buying a second one just to switch up the styles."
5,"Love this bundle Great value. Between my son’s creativity and my love of gift wrapping we go through a lot of scotch tape in my household!"
5,"Best board markers out there!!! This is the only brand and type of whiteboard markers I buy for home and office. The colors are bright, comes with an eraser on the tip and it’s two colors per marker! They’re magnetic and last a while! Perfect markers!"
5,"Fits perfect feels great I wear medium in most pants,  and mediums fit me perfect . They stay up and feel great I have no complaints."
2,"Too thin It's like they took the thinnest possible thickness for a folder that actually held up to light use and then squeezed it another 15%. They're just too thin. I know the thickness is listed, but I neglected to look at the ones I had for comparison. So if you're lazy like me and just looking for some cheap folders, look elsewhere, these aren't the folders you're looking for."
3,"Great idea, meh shoe The show and the fit is mostly ok, except because the heal is elevated it pushes your foot to slide forward, and because it’s a slip-on, there are no laces to hold foot in place."
1,"Wrong product and defective I bought the vindicator 2.0 alienware backpack for my 17 r4 and after further inspection, I found that the backpack was not the correct model. There were two different versions of this backpack made, and while my pack pack had the correct tag for what I ordered the backpack itself was the previous version.  The major issues with this were that the front pocket zipper was broken and also dethreaded at the seam, and the fabric on the straps was deteriorating. Along with these, the backpack wouldn't even fit my laptop due to its size and the incorrect backpack.  This was purchased through the Amazon Warehouse deals side and have never had an issue before with it until this product.  Hopefully, when I get my refund from this and purchase again, it is the correct backpack and nothing has been swapped around or incorrectly tagged"
1,"Don't like to have to pay for return when the product ... Too small. Thin material, as well. Don't like to have to pay for return when the product is not as described."
4,"Pretty Good I've had them for a few months now and I've only lost one top ball. That's pretty impressive for the price! Overall they look good and hold up pretty well."
4,"Battery life is kinda short. I bought this for my wife since she’s always cold and she loves it. Fabric is good quality."
4,"Nice but not perfect - tide functions difficult to use, alarm not audible and requires study to use I like the watch.  But you can forget using the alarm as the wakeup sound is not audible unless you are a 5 year old child.  Setting the tide graph is a bit difficult and it, in fact, takes a lot of time to really get to know and use all the watch functions. However, it works fine for the other functions (not tide charts) and seem very durable"
5,"Would recommend Great feel and look. Tested the compass and altimeter pretty cool and looks great."
5,"Great lasting colors These are great! I have been wearing these for months and the color has lasted. Very comfortable and easy to put in/take out. I love that there’s 3 different sizes options. Would definitely purchase again"
5,"Gorgeous and super light! Gorgeous, shiny, bold medium sized earrings.  I normally shy away from post earrings, but these are so amazing I am looking forward to wearing them.  Beautiful, I may go back for the gold."
5,"Would buy again Great shoe. A little big but not big enough to size down."
5,"Women are going to be chasing me at the airport. This is my initial reaction - I received the carry on but havent used it yet.  Why did I buy this?  For the looks, I also picked up a matching Thule laptop bag.  It's Expensive!!! It is more durable than my 15 year old $25 American Tourister carry on?  Probably not but time will tell.  Ive travelled around the world and coutless business trips with the American Tourister carry on and it holds up.  Does it have more space?  No, it actually has about half the space.  Is it better quality?  Yes it is better quality but not $300 worth.  More like $150-$200.  Is it a better design?  Lots of effort was put into it but I dont think it is any more functional than the $25 one.  So why did I buy it?  Lately I have been going on many 3-5 day business trips and I wanted to look good at the airport.  Lol - honest truth.  I will update this after my next trip."
5,"Comfortable shoes! They fit perfect, very comfortable!"
5,"Awesome, stylish backpack I love this backpack so much! It's perfect for travel, and I love how it looks pretty fashion-forward while still being super functional. It also looks like it should be a lot more expensive - what a find for 25 bucks! I can't wait to take it on my next trip. So happy with this purchase!"
5,"Great price buy it Like it’s quality and price"
5,"Great quality (as expected) Fantastic back pack!"
5,"Cant beat the taste! So so good. I did, however, find it for $2 cheaper in my grocery store. So, I'm taking it off my subscribe &amp; save so I can save more. This coffee is so smooth and does really well if you're into cold brewing as well. I love it. It's all I will drink now."
5,"Great top This top is so cute. I get tons of compliments on it at the gym. I love the material and the fit is relaxed so it’s not flapping around or clinging to me. It’s perfect."
5,"BEAUTIFUL NECKLACE I received this necklace for my birthday (of course it was in my wish list).  It is absolutely stunning.  I receive so many compliments when I wear it.  I purchased three of these for all my sisters for Christmas and told them it would remind us of our sisterly bond each time they wear it.  Of course, they all loved the necklace too."
5,"Love their bracelets but this one is extra special I love Alex and Ani bracelets and this one was the perfect gift for my mom to remind her my oldest brother (who was taken too soon) is not forgotten and is always with us. 💕 it’s such a beautiful bracelet and as always packaging is very nice—top notch"
2,"Broke within first few months I had this for a couple months and it's already broken. The timer works but the water level does not rise. When it worked it was great, fits a variety of bottle sizes which was nice early on as we learned which bottle our baby preferred. We were diligent about keeping sufficient water in it, but still broke, even tried a hard reset. Will be looking for a different brand this time."
3,"You pay a little you get a little Bought this unit based on price.  Looked at other name brands that were double the cost and probably should have gone that way.  The unit does vent very well and has the look that we wanted.  The unit came with a few small dents, the instructions were not very clear, the clock is only in 24hrs units, there is no customer service email or phone number and the LED lights are only bright enough to be used for ambiance."
1,"Worst earbuds I've ever had. Pros - None Cons - More expensive than similar headsets. - Unnecessarily bulky that if you wear a hoodie with these, they will pop out nonstop. - Because the earbuds are so bulky, they are designed in a weird curve design, making them highly uncomfortable. - Has the distance of bluetooth 4.1 if not worse, which I'm not sure how it's possible since it's supposed to be 5.0, you literally need your phone next to you at all times or else you will hear static. - Nothing in the instruction manual told me how to turn on or off the earbuds, had to find out by myself by holding each button. - Very short cord which has a rubbery flat design, which tugs on just about everything possible. - Button pad is extremely close to the right ear which gets in the way an awful lot."
1,"There are much better enema kits available The clamp is terrible and the silicone is sticky so lint and hair stick to it really bad.  No measurement markings on bag. I recommend the similar product made by premium enema,  it is much better and easier to use."
4,"Best travel bag I ever owned Best travel bag I ever owned.  Obviously someone who travels a lot designed this.  Perfect size for a carry on.  The middle small zipper compartment that doesn't go down all the way is still a bit of a mystery to me.  I slide my thin headphones into this area, but other than that, it's pretty limited on what it will fit / carry.  Still, a very well-made pack."
4,"cool tho scratchy love this watch as it’s easy to use and looks cool as hell. i don’t like how easily the screen can be damaged, however. upon the 3rd day - i noticed a cut on the front of the screen. nothing ridiculous but enough to realize they should have encoded it better. nonetheless i love this watch!"
4,"Nice but could be better these are nice compression leggings. I like them for my legs and backside. however they are not as high waisted as I wanted (I like it go above my belly button area by about an inch or more) these sit right at my waist and they have a very tight band at the waist so it makes the muffin top much worse. If I lose that muffin top they will be better LOL but still that's the most uncomfortable part of these."
5,"Every office needs one!! The best stapler I have ever owned!  Commercial grade."
5,"Great Product! I ordered this stamp and was pleasantly surprised by the quality, packaging and the speed in which I received it!  It’s smooth to operate; the lettering and ink are crisp.  It’s very reasonably priced and while I haven’t had it long enough to attest to durability, it seems like a great product."
5,"Design improvements My previous pair (Jaybird 3) shorted out from sweat after about 6 months. I have worn these running for a few weeks and so far, so good.  The ear bud is now integrated with the crescent, improving the fit and making it less likely that either will pop off.  There is skipping on crowded streets, as always with these things, but it is now less objectionable as there is a subtle fade-out and in that keeps time with the music. The little plastic thing that shortens the wire in the back is also simpler and easier to adjust.  Three nice improvements!"
5,"Very nice. Love the color. I'm 5' 10"" 137 and ordered a large. I wear a long sleeve crew neck under it for extra warmth. Just with it had pockets."
5,"The PERFECT bag As a frequent business traveler, I love my new eBag.  This one is perfect.  Holds everything and I carry a lot of items.  The ONLY improvement I would suggest is they build in and include a shoulder strap should one wish to use it as such.  It does have the ability to be carried from either sides handle but I miss having a regular shoulder strap."
5,"Delivery on time. This item was a gift for a very special person who absolutely loved it.  I was not please with the delivery.  It was one date late but I  got over it.  Great gift item!!"
5,"Great watch I own 10 plus Invicta watches.  I like this style within any color the best.  Of my three white colored watches, this is my favorite as the face of the watch has a higher end appearance that my others."
5,"Five Stars Super convenient to put this on the subscribe and save list. Huge box, plastic applicator, does the job."
5,"I always wanted a Seiko watch but I could not ... I always wanted a Seiko watch  but I could not afford the price but because fo Amazon's prices  I was able to buy one."
5,"Five Stars Very beautiful and classy watch. Both the the band and bezel are very classy"
5,"Getting lots of compliments Nobody believes me when i tell them i got this back for $26 and it’s not real leather. I’ve gotten lots of compliments on it. It does have a small padded section for laptop or iPad, i think the padded area is too small for a laptop and makes the bag awkward to carry. Otherwise it’s a really nice bag for a good price."
5,"actually not that bad looking in person actually not that bad looking in person.  not nearly as blue as the photo but you cant expect everything to be as the pictures when you order"
5,"Daughter loves it! My daughter absolutely loves this sloth necklace. It is good quality for the price and really is so cute."
2,"Uncomfortable Great display. Good watch. However, extremely uncomfortable."
3,"Three Stars Had expensive ones, but this one does the job.Blade mounted well and lays flat on window."
3,"Comfortable, but not always easy to read. It's a decent and comfortable watch overall, but it has it's distractions. I bought the watch to wear day and night while recovering from surgery. It has has not completely met my needs, but my needs are probably not typical.  The pros are it is light weight, easy to get on and off. It seems rugged enough and it's fairly attractive. The band is very comfortable and can be left on for long periods of time without discomfort.It's top from a comfort standpoint.  The cons are that when you get the band wet while washing your hands it is annoying until it drys with can take a while. I now take it off to wash my hands. Also the night light feature is good, but the design of hands makes it difficult to see the time when using the light. Since I am wearing this day and night, I have to put on my glasses to see the time when using the night light. If the hands had been solid from stem to end it would be much easier easier to read, especially with the hands are close together."
1,"Terrible waste of unnecessary packing material I bought this from Costco yesterday and I have to say that I have no real complaints about the panty liner itself. It works alright so far.  My favorite ones are the Kotex unscented panty liners but Costco stopped selling them so I decided to try these. This brand is NOT environmentally friendly as there are way too much packaging materials for so little product (144 liners)!  When you open the first box, there are 6 smaller boxes. In each of the smaller box, they are wrapped in another plastic wrap holding only 24 liners - why the extra plastic. Each of the liners are individually wrapped. Then you have a separate adhesive peel.  Other brands I've seen consolidate the individually wrap packaging as the adhesive peel. There are way too many layers of packaging before you get to the product. They advertise this item as being ""Healthy for You and the Environment"".  Why not make it 2 bigger boxes and fill it with 72 liners. Skip the plastic packaging altogether."
1,"Really g-shock Paid up for this watch because of what I read about it. It was my first g-shock. However I had to return it. One of the buttons used to set the time needed a vice grip practically to press it in to the point where it would work. I was literally unable to compress the button on multiple tries. It shouldn’t be that difficult. Thus, I wasn’t able to change the time to military time, which is one of the reasons I bought it in the first place. Very disappointed."
4,"My 10yr old bought this for her mom. I had to have it repaired the cost was minimum, but my wife likes it."
4,"good bottle I have been using the Dr BROWN bottle since my baby was 2 months old. Like the bottle. But the only reason i give it 4 stars not 5 is because it doesn't have a box for it. They only use a plastic bag to wrap it"
5,"Great value! Perfect for party favors!"
5,"Love it Very large perfect for sports!"
5,"Great for running or HIIT workouts!! I really enjoy these leggings! They're super flattering and suck you in. I love running and doing HIIT workouts in them! The drawstring is an amazing feature that many high end brands lack. They actually stay in place! This definitely makes them stand  out. Have washed them several times and they've held their quality. They do run a bit smaller but I still wore them and had no issues. Would buy again!!"
5,"Great deal Great pair of headphones and awesome price"
5,"Got exactly what I paid for...Quality! Beautiful jacket and warm. The fit was perfect for my daughter although I would've liked a larger size to accommodate growth for next year. The color was spot on and the quality was northface worthy!"
5,"Try them! My pants needed to be longer. The top fitted fine, but my pants are to short. My height is 5'8. But I'm going to enjoy wearing them with my bobbie socks. Thank You!"
5,"great quality Great product!! I feel like these are made so much more thick now, which prevents frail in the wash! Definitely would order these on amazon from now on."
5,"Totally worth it! Great value, great quality, great variety.  A pair of earrings to go with just about every outfit!  I live this set."
5,"MUST HAVE! Awesome product, I’ve literally only used ONE capsule so far (1)!!!.. &amp; everything has improved, it’s been 3 days since the first time used it &amp; I’m not even feeling the need to use it again ! Love it"
5,"Yes, it works. works as well as combipatch. day sweats and night sweats gone, as well as osteoporosis long bone pain gone. Thank you."
5,"Good thanks Its great as long as I don't crack the lid."
5,"Tough watch with just enough features Nice watch. Very durable. The compass seems to work well and it seems to be built well. I like the fact the day and date are visible as well as the time. Not over complicated like a lot of watches. Seems perfect for me as I can be pretty rough on a watch. I love the solar charging too."
5,"Love them!!!! This is the second brand I have tried. I loved them both. I will never go back! The photo shows a Always ultra thin overnight pad next to Wegreeco Bamboo pad that is 9.5 inches long. If you are wondering how many you need a month, I personally use around 10 each month. I have 2 heavy days, one medium day and 2 very light days each month. I feel these are more ""natural"" than tampons and the diva cup. They also add chemicals in pads, diva cup and tampons, and that is not cool."
2,"Shorted out the 2nd time I switched it on. Firstly, this book light is very bright, all things considered. However, I would definitely NOT call it a ""warm"" light. The light color is white - not anywhere close to ""warm light."" When I turned the light on the first time, I was impressed with how bright it was. I took it (with a book) into a dark room and was amazed at how well it lit up the entirety of both pages of a 5x8-inch book. All of the letters were crisp, even the ones at the very bottom of the pages. But if, say, you had a partner who was sleeping next to you in bed and you were trying to read yourself to sleep, this is not the light for you. The whiteness is too stark a contrast - it's the same principle as not having blue lights in your room... something about the hue of the blue lights wake you up more. This light is so white that I'd almost consider it blue.  That's where my positive experience with this book light ends. The switch on the top of the light feels flimsy and breakable. And... it broke. The light turned on easily right out of the box and stayed on. But then I turned it off to verify how flimsy the switch felt, and now the light won't stay on - it turns on and off depending on where I'm touching it. The light will stay lit if I press down on the light housing or the switch itself, but that kind of defeats the purpose of being able to attach the light to the book.  I'll be returning this. The 2nd star is for how bright the light is, and for how lightweight the light itself is. But I'd be more than willing to give up a little on the weightlessness of the light if it meant that the light/switch wouldn't short out/break so easily. Without the brightness &amp; weightlessness of the light, it would definitely get only one star."
3,"As a college students that may need multiple books/notebooks during the day it gets annoying having to choose between taking the peccary books or ... The backpack is well designed. Although it only has 3 main pockets, they have pockets and pouches within in them that allow you to fit more than you would expect. I have had this backpack for 3 months now. The only thing that bothers me is the quality of the zipper used for the main compartment. If you filly it to its capacity the zipper will fail half the time. It will cause the back pack to randomly unzip open. As a college students that may need multiple books/notebooks during the day it gets annoying having to choose between taking the peccary books or having to zip my backpack multiple times on my way to classes. If you like to carry a lot of books I do not recommend it, but if you don't tend to push backpacks to a carrying capacity then this is a great backpack."
1,"Very disappointed Taste worse than coffee from food truck on street. This is one of my worse coffee I tried. I opened the box yesterday and tried a few of them and thru away because I could not take it."
1,"Not sticky I had settled on this duct tape brand in the past as my go-to standard.  I decided to buy a larger roll and to my disappointment the tape is not ""duct tape"" sticky.  If one makes a mistake with duct tape and it folds to adhere to itself, this should not be something that can be undone.  With this tape it is easily undone."
4,"Es un poco fragil Buen producto pero está un poco frágil"
4,"More Fitted Than Expected But Still Worth It 5'9"" 160 34DD - ordered a medium. They are a little more fitted than I would like but I'm vowing not to dry them. The material is nice, but thinner. They will make a great layering piece in the winter. I wish they came in different color combos - I liked the grey but only had the option of grey/berry. The berry is just not my style. It's not too bright so I'll make it work."
4,"Poor Build I thought I had purchased a great set of ear buds for little to no money.  What I have no fun.  As other reviewers have noticed there are sound problems with failing right ear bud.  Its late February I received them in late November. I am not a daily user but yes sometimes I use them at work 4 times a week.  Bottom line I have no choice of return so have to go looking for a replacement pair.    I do hope to find a pair of ear buds that live up to their advertised hype with quality builds. Well back to browsing for reliable name brands e.g. LG, SAMSUNG etc."
5,"Smart purchase... Great looking watch, get lots of compliments on it. This was my 21nd G Shock purchase over a few years. By far one of my favorites!!!"
5,"this is the best deal thank you Amazon I bought 2 one for ... this is the best deal  thank you Amazon I bought 2  one for my home and one for my office works great its a slim look saves on power and very quiet running"
5,"The BEST joggers yet!!! I am in-love with these joggers!!! Not only are they comfortable, but they're very well made. I haven't washed them yet, but thusfar; I haven't been disappointed and receive several compliments."
5,"Five Stars Really does what it claims."

5,"Like water resistance and charging case. Big fan! I held off providing a review until I had a chance to really push the earbuds to their limits. I bought them primarily for the water proof ability advertised because As a runner my ear buds will get wet for many reasons. This model performs well on this feature. I even took 2 showers with the buds in and never had a problem.  I ran for 2 hours today and the right earbud I used never had a problem. When I returned home I did get a low battery warning. I run with only one earbud at a time for safety reasons so the two earbuds will get me through 4 hours of running with no problem.  The case charges the earbuds so if I take the case I could go at least 8 hours but that’s way beyond my range!  It took a while to figure out but I was able to understand how to connect the left bud separately from the right one. When you take the two out at the same time they connect to each other for right and left channels. Then the right earbud connects to my phone as a device named T40. Music plays in both ears in this mode. If you remove the left earbud and leave the right one in the case, it can connect as a device named T40L. Once the left earbud is connected to a phone then you can take the right one out of the case and connect to a different phone or tablet as the T40 device name.  So far I am a big fan of this earbud product!"

5,"Finally in order Great for organizing at work"
5,"Great Product Works great!!"
5,"I love these very nice good deal I love them wanted a pair of long silver lever backs want a pair in gold like these too."
5,"Unique and elegant lightweight watch I bought this watch for my boyfriend as a Father’s Day gift and he love it. It’s unique style made of wood caught my attention and it looks very elegant as well. He removed his old watch ASAP and put this one on."
2,"Great colors, Poor sizing and it ""peels"" I purchased three in different colors. According to the size chart I need an XL. Not! They are all too big. I did buy the same sports bra at a Kohls store in a size L (large). Perfect fit.  Another thing I hate about this bra is I washed them all before wearing them (I have sensitive skin), and The bras ""peeled"" like cheap polyester sweaters peel. Never had that happen with a sports bra. Therefore once the peeling happens you cannot wear the bra alone or out. It must be worn under something or it looks cheap and cheesy."
3,"will not buy again Okay. Bristles do not last long. Cannot clean a wide variety of different size straws with them. Will not work with sippy cups. Basically for your standard drinking straw or little larger ones."
1,"TOTAL CRAP This backpack leaks through the seams.  I walked about 4 blocks under an umbrella through some mild rain, and water leaked through the seams into the backpack.  All of my papers inside were ruined, and I am grateful that there was no damage done to my laptop.  This does not repel water, it absorbs it.  My return window closed 3 days ago, else I would be sending this back.  Do not waste your money."
1,"In fact, nearly unusable Some nice features, but at this price and with Cuisinart on the label it should really be good if not wonderful!  If you grind for a strong brew, it will overflow -- no way to avoid it, because the water comes in too fast. Even in careful operations, with underground coffee, resulting in a medium brew, you risk overflow because entire system depends on a little plastic hook on basket. And there is a gap in the basket at the ""handle"" where even a millimeter dip in a paper filter will result in over flow down outside of basket. This thing needs a screen at the top of the pot.  You'd think thermal pot design would have improved by now. This pot is cute and plump but almost has to be completely turned upside down to finish pouring. And it splatters. Always. Every time. It is in fact the worst pouring experience I can remember in 10 or so autopots used over the years.  We've turned to pouring the coffee through a fine strainer into a Zojirushi thermal pot (which we have because the hardware on that one was junk and failed after a year).  This pot is also not as easy to pour water into as it should be. Why make it so imprecise and indefiniite? An oddball space at back right inviting a mess in early morning operations.  The buttons -- why do they always put nearly never used buttons all lined up with buttons used daily? Weird. Poor design. I guess they liked the 5 button look, but how often do you set your clock? Or run a cleaning operation?  Yes, I know, we could use the metal filter, but we abandoned using those things 20 years ago. Too water wasteful to clean and we get tired of coffee ""dust"" in the bottom of the cup.  We decided to live with the awkwardly-pouring thermal pot, the slightly tricky snap-tab on the basket, the poorly designed water reservoir, and even the lack fo really robust coffee production -- but NOT the 3-4 times per week failure of the basket/waterflow design.  The search continues. I have a horrible feeling there is no good answer and we'll be reduced to the mess of French press, which produces the best coffee per one's taste, and pouring into the old Zojirushi thermal pot."
4,"Great quality Sturdy, very nice leather, and a beautiful bag.  Only hiccup is the interior space is smaller than what I had hoped."
4,"Overall, Great Buy! I haven't had this backpack for very long, but I have been exceptionally satisfied with the purchase thus far. It feels comfortable on my back, is functional for every day use and large enough for all of my items for class, work and gym combined.  I would have given it five stars, but for a few cons: I received the backpack with the stitching frayed in two places. While it has not impacted the functionality, for the price, I would have expected it to not have any frayed stitching. I also would have liked one or two shallow pockets, as these pockets are relatively big and things can easily get lost of the bottom of them, but, again, not a total downer.  Regardless, I'm very happy with this purchase!"
5,"Yaaaasss! These pants are everything!  I ordered according to their charts in my normal size and length, everything fit perfectly. I wore them today to work with heels and a top and cardigan . They looked great felt great, perfect. They are thick enough that you don’t see through them and they are super comfortable."
5,"Gift she loved Was a gift for you daughter and she really loved it seams to be well made .. very happy with the necklace"
5,"Great book bag for many uses Great sturdy book bag for my son, which has plenty of room for several outfits, books, etc, to travel."
5,"Love this jacket! Great for trail running Wore this on a 7 hour trail run through wet conditions with a hydration pack over the top and was extremely comfortable.  It's breathes well and is waterproof.  I'm 5'4"", 115 lbs and the x-small fits perfectly."
5,"It's great This my 2nd one.. I hve the cream one.. I luv these"
5,"The best baselayer I've ever owned Perfect fit. 98cm chest, ordered a large. I now own two of them. They're so useful and kept me warm with a cycling jersey ontop in 45-60 degree weather but had to add another waffle knit for sub 45F. Protects well from the wind, just wish the neck area came up higher.  Material is super soft, super stretchy and stays in place even during heavy wind or sprinting."
5,"Smooth and Strong, Like I Like My Men, I am in LOVE!! I started drinking coffee because I'm a busy mom with a busy job and a busy life... LOL The stuff at work is free, thanks! but it tastes like turpentine... and tea wasn't cuttin it. Some of my co-workers hipped me to drinking coffee black. Yeah, a real struggle. It was really bitter and gross, no thank you. But I was motivated to make the switch, so I searched here on Amazon and figured 16,000+ people can't be wrong, what the heck!  I was a little nervous, so I brought my bag to work to share with my co-workers. OMG, me and my girl started talkin about different dimensions, and had the most productive day EVER! LOL  But for reals, this coffee tastes good, nice flavor and aftertaste is delicious.  I like the energy I get. I think I started something at the office, everyone is asking when I'm making another pot hahaha, like junkies. I spoiled them for sure."
5,"Great quality - Super handy Love these bigger storage bottles. I use them for formula (wasn’t able to breastfeed) and take them to go with me. It’s also handy being able to put water in them to mix with formula later. Great quality as well. They do screw on to the medela pumps as well so if you’re producing more than the 5oz bottles that the pump comes with you can’t totally use them for that too!"
5,"Very pretty! It’s very pretty, just as shown. I have only had it a short time but seems like good quality.  Also came with a bonus gift."
5,"Very nice looking Makes an outstanding gift very nice looking."
5,"Love these necklaces This comes as a set of three separate necklaces. I love that I can separate these and wear them with other necklaces I have found on Amazon. Sometime Soon I wear all three together. The different lengths help change up the look. I’m so pleased with my purchase!

5,"Great product..! Perfect for ninja coffee maker"
5,"INTERDIGITAL BLISTERS I never normally write reviews but I am so pleased with these that I felt it necessary.  I was training for a half marathon and my toes were getting torn up. I bought the 30 dollar socks recommended by professional runners, relaced my shoes, wrapped them in tape and bandaids (which just led to more blisters) and covered them in anti-chafing cream. Nothing worked. I was still getting horrendous inter-digital blisters that were preventing me from running at all.  I ordered these out of desperation, hoping, but not actually thinking that they would solve my problems.  Well, they did. I wore these socks, ran 10 miles, and my feet felt amazing. No blisters. I wear them any time I plan to run over 6 miles and I haven't had any issues. The only time I get blisters now are when these socks are dirty and I am forced to wear others.  At $10 a pair, they are not inexpensive, but they are totally worth it."
5,"Perfect winter hiking / dog walking pant! Love these pants! I bought two similar style pants on amazon and these by far are the best!  I'm 5'5"", 170lbs, usually wear a size 12 in pants. The pants fit perfectly based on the size chart. The legs are the perfect amount of skinny, not so tight that u cant move, enough slack that you can bend easily, but not so much that when u hike or move they are cumbersome.  Definitely will buy these again, just wish there were more color options!"
2,"Caution: Not Designed to Taste like the Non-Organic Version I love Good Earth sweet and spicy tea and have for years.  I figured the organic version would be roughly the same. Nope.  I had other people try it as well and it distinctly tastes the way potting soil smells.  And very light on cinnamon not that that matters much given the dirt taste. I emailed the company and clearly identified the issue including the soil-flavor details, requesting a replacement 6-pack.  Instead they explained that “the Organic versions of the GE teas were meant to be different tasting from their conventional counterpoints.” So that taste was apparently deliberate and not a bad batch of tea."
3,"I like them however... I bought these 2 for my post surgery recovery, I had breast augmentation one week ago and i wanted to have more than the one they gave me at the hospital, unfortunately this one rolls up when you sit and moves up as you walk I don’t recommend it because it touches your wound. I bought large the fit is good is just the underpart. Maybe they’ll be less uncomfortable in the near future when my wound is completely healed. I will wear them to workout!"
3,"I like it, dont love it I'm a 38 DDD and it's a little bit on the small side. I think they need to make a xxl. That being said it does offer good support without wires. I just don't like the boob spillage out the sides."
1,"No!! Stiff and unusable from either end. DON'T BUY THIS!!!"
1,"Cheap and ugly This necklace is horrid, the quality and color scheme us ugly!!! don't waste your money."
4,"Love these bottles but too expensive 70+ dollars no thanks Would be 5 stars me and my baby love these bottles and I love the cute design but with the price tag it has I won't be buying more (which I need to do but I won't because of the price). $30 dollars for 4 bottles and 4 size 2 nipples. (you don't get a choice in nipple size) $10+ dollars for 4 nipples of different size. 0, 1, 3, 4 (if you need all sizes) $40+ dollars So for 4 bottles your baby can use (as intended by the company) from birth to 6m+ you're looking at a price tag of $70+ dollars (with prime free shipping and not including tax)!! FOR 4 BOTTLES I don't know just seems a bit steep to me for a bit of plastic and some silicone..  Other than that I absolutely love the bottles and wish they had more cute designs.. All and all I won't be buying more but I would recommend to a friend who has a bigger budget to spend on baby bottles."

5,"Comfortable Comfort insertion and even absorption!"
2,"Poor quality Doesn't seem to last any longer than refilled cartridges I buy in town, and refilled ink prints better too!  Very low quality printing with HP brand ink in my HP Officejet.  Lose-lose for HP."
3,"Nice watch but will the features work for a long time? This is my second Pathfinder watch.  The first one, after a few years, started having issues.  the compass, altimeter, and barometer functions all stopped working.  Finally the whole face display faded out and has never come back.  Iv'e had other brands that also, after a few years, would break down.  I decided to try Pathfinder again as I like the style, the features are fun to have and play with, and perhaps Casio has improved the product to last longer this time.  If you buy this, enjoy it while it works."
1,"Colors not the same as on the Cap My Granddaughter was overjoyed to receive these markers, but she was very disappointed because the ink colors are not the same as the caps.  The set has 3 pink shades and the actual markers are red - not pink at all."
1,"Worthless I've owned this watch for a year and a half and it never kept very good time and for the last six months it's dropped 6 minutes a day So I returned it to the factory warranty center who demand $28 up front for return shipping,they didn't even comment on my warranty claim and said they would fix it for $148!-this for a watch that cost about $80. I think Invicta makes pretty watches that are junk and they make their warranty useless on purpose. Never again! An update on the warranty service by International Watch Service Center / IWSC  of Sandy Utah who seems to an accomplice in shafting Invicta customers. When I first told them to send it back they then quoted a 40% lower price! When I still said no and what about the warranty  which when I bougt the watch was 3 years they then claimed my crystal was cracked and let water in therefore no warranty which was and outrageous fabrication. Invicta and IWSC are the kind of companys that should be avoided ,their cheats!"
1,"Band keeps getting torn loose This watch has a design problem.  The case ""ears"" that the band attaches to are frequently snagging on anything they get near, such as sleeves of shirts or coats I'm putting on, cabinet doors, drawers, etc.  The result is that the band is ripped off.  I've even bought replacement spring bars so I could put the band back on.  Today the watch snagged again and the watch flew to the floor, its back flying off.  I've thrown the whole d*** thing in the trash.  No, I've never had this problem with any other watch."
4,"Beautiful Watch, but VERY SHORT (and cheap-looking) Watchband Beautiful watch, very classy and stylish...but a VERY short watchband (I've got larger-than-average wrists, but they're not huge....and I almost had to return the watch because it wouldn't fit).  As it is, I have to use the very last hole on the strap, and it's a bit tight (and there is no way possible to add a new hole).  So I'll have to buy a new separate watchbband (which seems a bit unfair after having paid over $300 for this watch). The ""leather"" band is also faux crocodile skin, and looks very plasticky. If they had used a good band, and if it fit properly, I'd have given a full five stars (but the band issue is serious enough to lower my rating to only 4 stars)."
4,"love these, this color was off color was unlike the screen. i have bought these before and love them. company was good with returns"
5,"Tenaciously beautiful! I have been procrastinating on repairing my eVent REI Jacket that was ripped by the zipper. I have been looking for a product that will really stick, hold, and be thin enough that it won't snag the zipper. Duct tape nor other tapes will not do its job compared to this product. The moment you stick it on, it's there and fused. So you need to be careful in placing it. Plan ahead for when you try to peel if off and re-attach, it will not. I have not rated durability yet. We'll see as the day goes by."
5,"Nice Sturdy and durable, easily carry all school books."
5,"Great Coffee!  Great Price! Each cup tastes fresh and this blend is hearty and on the strong side.  Not weak, but robust with flavor!  Good Morning!  Green Mountain coffees have been consistent in quality of the K-cup and coffee flavor.  Some brands actually have defective cups that leak grounds...what a mess and waste of money!  I buy a large amount at a time, and the first cup is a fresh as the last one.  I compared the price with the grocery store K-cups and found that using Prime with free shipping, these are about $.50/cup vs $.75 to $1.25/cup in stores or on other sites.  I believe you can find a similar price at the big outlet stores, but if you don't want to make that car trip and hassle the parking and crowds, Amazon.com Prime is the way to go.  Great coffee, Great price!"
5,"Good sound, battery life is awesome. First pair lasted less than 48 hours. But, they were easily and quickly replaced. For what these cost, you can't beat them. They sound good, stay on the ear and when I use them for hands free calling in my truck no one complains about the sound of the call. PLUS the battery life is great. 12+ hours on a charge for constant music/video streaming. Also haven't had a problem staying connected to my phone or tablet. I'm almost 4 months in with this pair, will gladly purchase another pair when these wear out."
5,"Five Stars Looks great and arrived quick!!! Just as described!"
5,"Cheap, Effective, Helpful I got the file folders expecting to have to tag them myself, but they come with labels/tags that easily go on. they fit standard Letter length drawers, not Legal size. Colors are Green, Red, Blue, Yellow, and Orange"
5,"Five Stars perfect"
5,"Five Stars My grandson loves it!"
5,"Almost Perfect Backpack...Still Tempted To Purchased A Second One I was randomly perusing through Amazon’s product’s on line and ran across this backpack. After reading up on the backpack features and reviews, I figured why not? This backpack is large enough and have many pockets and storage areas. I like having a backpack to carry random necessities for work, everyday out and about things, or for long travel/trips. This one looks good and it’s very well put together. I’m accustomed to seeing loose threads on products such as this but I’ve yet to find one anywhere!! As far as being water resistant...I ran water from the kitchen sink over the backpack and the water beaded up and didn’t soak in the material but the backpack is brand new and I cannot say for a fact how it would hold up for a sustained period of time in rain or water! Important note! The backpack is water resistant not water proof! I’m even thinking about treating it with scotch guard. In my opinion, this backpack would be perfect if it had an added compartment for ccw and possibly another compartment for a protective ballistic plate. I’m very tempted to purchase another one despite missing these two components!"
5,"Seem to do the job for which they were intended These work better than period pads.  I like the long length.  Seems to cover well.  It would be nice if the adhesive was a little bit stronger.  Seems like it used to be, but lately not.  Of course, it has been a very hot summer and that could have something to do with it.  Time will tell, but I will keep using these as I hate the other ""A"" brand."
5,"Very nice Sub $30 headphones I still can't believe we can get truly wireless headphones for $30 or less.  Crazy. What I like: 1.  I really like the slight curve of the ""stalk"" of the headphones.  It helps them stay more secure and they hug the contours of my face better, so they don't stick out as much as others I've seen (and the few I've tried). 2.  The MFB works well with a good click. 3.  You can use them independently without having both out...or share one with a friend. 4.  Good balanced sound...not too bassy and not all treble. 5.  Compact charging case...easily fit in a pocket. 6.. Was surprised at the packaging...very well packed and it actually looks nice!  Would make a good gift-giving experience. I tested the battery life on a laptop, running in the background...because I would probably never play any headphones for more than a couple of hours straight.  They actually lasted a little over 4 hours...as advertised. I was playing them at a little over half volume."
5,"Gorgeous necklace, great quality What a beautiful necklace! My mom absolutely loved it. It’s so much better quality than I was expecting and the display is amazing. I know the seller takes great care in this product. Thank you!"
5,"Love it! Love it!"
2,"Would not keep a constant connection. Sound quality is great with the included foam covers.  They are comfortable around the ears with the bendable wire and do not fall out during running.  BUT...they would not keep a connection during my run!  They kept cutting in and out!  Odd because they seemed to work fine when I tested them upon their arrival only a couple days before.  They were fully charged so I'm not sure what the problem is.  Unfortunately I will have to send them back because this is not acceptable."
3,"Modest Microwave for a Modest Price Fairly average product and you get what you pay for with this. It’s not the worst but it’s far from a perfect product. The setup is a little odd in that you absolutely have to have the Alexa app to get it through the setup process and there are lost connections often while trying to get it all to connect. Once it’s setup, the microwave is fairly straightforward in operation. It’s a bit small but works for most things, it’s not the most powerful but definitely gets the job done. The upside of it being a little underpowered is that it isn’t as loud as many other standard units which is a welcome feature. The buttons don’t operate as smooth as other units but again you get what you pay for with this unit and for a relatively inexpensive microwave with a small counter footprint that is used for heating up small amounts of food or leftovers, this seems like a decent pick among others in this price range."
3,"What I liked: The bag looks bad ass What I liked: The bag looks bad ass. Has a lot of space and fits great on your back. Very comfortable to wear. The zipper opening  to the laptop compartment is pretty awesome for the quick access to your tablet or laptop.  What i didn't like: The main compartment cover. This was the deal breaker. While it makes the bag look awesome it also kills its accessibility and functionality. The cover makes it pretty hard to access the front bottom compartment with out unlatching the hooks to the cover which is a pain.  Also the main compartment is a pain to access. The cover does not completely flip to the back side of the backpack to allow easy access to the main compartment. You have to unhook the cover and hold it up with one hand while you dig in the bag with the other. So to  grab something quick you have to put the pack on something so you use both hands to get what ever you want out.  It might be just with the new models but this bag did not have the bottom vent holes and the waist strap has all plastic buckles vs the metal buckles on some other models.  Another thing i noticed was the shoulder straps had very little if any padding. I never found this to be an issue because it fit very well on my back but it may be if you plan on carrying a lot of weight over an extended period of time."
1,"Leaks a ton I love the old style of dr brown, but this new wide neck style leaks so bad."
4,"Thin face and short strap for a man's wrist. This watch looks neat and clean and is very easy to read.  I like the thin face because I almost never bang it on stuff like my chunkier watches of yesteryear.  The crystal on those was always scratched!  The strap however is very short for a man's wrist and barely is long enough for me to wear."
4,"they are not compatable with the spectra s2 breastpump saw in the questions and answers that they are compatible with the spectra s2 breastpump but they are not."
4,"Brilliant robot! Great robot for the price point of $400. Watch reviews of these robots on the YouTube channel VacuumWars. Greatly enjoy the mapping and optional setting for a quieter run."
5,"Best Velcro Watch Ever! Love this watch! The strap is way more adjustable than the usual buckles, it has no unnecessary features, can withstand swims and showers, lights up with the press of a button (won't even disturb a dark theater), easy to program and read, and also brightly colored! I got the red one for myself and I plan to get the blue one for my little brother since it is super adaptable to fit most wrists. It may not be the fanciest, but I would never wear any other watch. The velcro does eventually wear out, but I've extended the lifespan by dragging a scissor blade across the stiffer part and that seems to work. Battery never has run out and it's been a few years. Thing has taken quite a beating too (drops, bumps, throws courtesy of a ten year old brother, etc.) and all that ever did to it was a tiny scrape on the plastic, when it put a noticeable hole in the wall. The watch is bulletproof durable (but seriously don't actually shoot at it) 100% a great buy and will buy again as long as it sells, especially at the low price for the quality you get. Also, my pictures are of my watch at a year and a half old, so it is not brand new but has been worn every day for about 500 days. Give or take a few. And it still works like new!"
5,"Great Comfortable"
5,"Good for my use!! Perfect for my use!! I use them to blot out addresses to pass on magazines, mark moving boxes and they are thick enough to be noticeable from a few feet away. They do smell a bit, but all markers do unless you get the color markers that smell like fruit!!"
5,"Reliable, dependable, high price/value ratio What can I say? Every time I order Amazon Basics (batteries for example, computer cables, etc), they knock it out of the park. Now, it might be easy to say filing folders are a simple item, blah blah blah. But it's just as easy and tempting to go cheapo on an item like this with labels that don't tear or write well, plastic hangers that detach, and folders that can't handle more than a feather's worth of paper before giving in. I've dealt with that but these aren't going to win a beauty pageant, but they'll change your motor oil for you."
5,"Great Find! Absolutely love these. Not very heavy. I’ve been wearing them everyday since I got them!"
5,"High quality piece of kit. Love everything about this watch but one.  The dial illumination needs to be stronger and stay on longer.  Still 5 stars though.  I wish I would have gotten the one with white numbers, but that was a personal mistake, not a product problem."
5,"Works great. I''m the husband.  I'm not giving details.  It works great.  Nuff said."
5,"Good coffee Nice flavor"
5,"good quality amazing storage space very nice back pack. I received it earlier than the actual delivery date and when I came in, to my surprise it looked way bigger in person than on the photos. I just got it so I don’t know how durable it is but the quality of the backpack is really nice.  I just got it so I don’t know how durable it is but the quality of the backpack is really nice. I recommend this.💯"
5,"Perfect Sports Bra! IT FIT ME!!! Hallelujah!! I attend both Yoga and Pilates classes and had been looking for a well fitting workout sports bra. It took a few tries and purchases to finally find this bra. I can wear it as a top or as a bra. It fits perfectly and I'm so glad my search is over. It's a great piece when my classes wear me out. I will be purchasing another one. Great find! Thank you!"
5,"Great little light! This is a great little light to have if you are an avid reader. I enjoy reading before I go to bed, but hated having to turn the light on for the entire room, reason being that my cat would see the light on and think it was play time. The 3 settings are great, for me to read comfortably, I only need to use the lowest setting and I'm fine. Being able to flex the arm to where you need it is great also, as other book lights I've tried in the past had a stationary arm that want helpful when I was either at the beginning or toward the latter part of the book. I would recommend this to others."
5,"I would buy this again I absolutely love this bag! I’m definitely an over-packer and this back can fit all my items and some. Although I do love this bag and would definitely buy it again or give as gift, there are cons I’ve noticed. The zippers sometimes get caught for no reason. There are so many darn pockets and zippers it’s easy to forget where you put something it. When the bag is filled it can get heavy due to its ability to hold so much. Still highly recommend."
5,"Five Stars I've wanted one of these forever and finally bought myself one after leaving a long-time job. Childhood dreams achieved!"
2,"Two Stars they're scented, I don't think I realized that when I ordered them."
3,"tangled earring. one earring was tangled when i received it. i can’t wear it because of that. other than that the product is beautiful"
1,"Too long and thin They were not what I expected. I wanted the pants to exercise at the gym, but the material is too thin. They are only good to be in your house. Also, they are so long that they would fit a six-foot person; I'm 5'4''. I usually buy exercise pants at sports stores and never have to take in the hem. To be able to wear these, I will have to take in about six inches. If I had bought them at a store, I would definitely return them, but I do not want to go through the trouble of having to go to the post office and pay for the return."
1,"Falling apart. The backpack is already falling apart. It looks great, but the shoulder strap is already coming undone from the main bag itself. Would have given 5 stars, but didn’t expect it needed to be replaced so soon."
1,"Horrible and Dangerous Product This is by far the worst pair of headphones I have ever owned. I try to watch a movie on my laptop- and all of the sudden the headophones crank the volume ALL the way up- damaging my ears badly. I think, maybe the volume control is just stuck- but no- this is just how this product is. I can't watch a movie on my laptop, I can't listen to music on my iphone- because this product does not work. I seriously cannot even believe that amazon is selling these on their website. These are dangerous and horrible products- judging from what everyone else has had to say- it seems as if these issues are the norm. Very dissapointed. Order something else."
4,"It has issues that Casio should fix but I'm irrationally in-like with it. I have mixed feelings about this. On the one hand, there are several unpleasant aspects of this watch that aren't apparent until you wear it but, on the other hand, I find myself reaching for this over other of my (even much more expensive) favorite(s). I guess it has become my current favorite, in fact.  Here's my list of what you should be aware of, if you're considering this watch  Issue #1. The solar battery: Unlike Citizen and Seiko solar watches, Casio evidently hasn't quite got their technology refined. I have a solar charger https://smile.amazon.com/Casio-Citizen-Charger-CoolFire-Professional/dp/B00ZOWJI7A/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1500065871&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=watch+solar+charger that works *beautifully*, normally producing a full charge (that never waivers for *years*) in less than 8 hours for the (several of each) Seiko &amp; Citizen solar watches that I have. I noticed, though, that it took about twice that for my Casio Oceanus (my prior favorite) to charge. Before this, I attributed that to the Oceanus' atomic time feature  BUT my experience with *this* watch makes me question whether it's the Casio solar technology itself.  This watch has taken 36 hours to charge (well over 4 times usual), reach &amp; stay at high charge for more than a day and *still* it keeps falling back into mid-level every couple of days (Mid-level means that some features stop working until it's charged) That's an annoyance for me, with the charger, but it *could* be a much bigger issue if you don't have a charger and you don't work outside in the sun. I *suspect* (but haven't tested the hypothesis) that it's due to the auto-light which relates to issue  #2  Issue #2. The lume. This watch is only lumed on the hands and it lasts -- even after charging with a high-powered flashlight -- for little more than 4-5 hours. There are 3 problems with this: A) Since there's no lume on the dial to orient the position of the hands at night, it's difficult to read the time even *when* it's visible and B) If you sleep for more than 5 hours in the dark, it's difficult to tell the time at all and C) that means you are going to rely upon the built-in LED light and THAT's the origin of issue #1:  The watch has an auto-light which is activated by turning your wrist BUT, if you activate it at night, it'll (apparently) *frequently* be activated while sleeping, running down the battery and forcing you to *often* charge it. I have to turn the auto-light off to save the battery and *that* forces me to wake up enough at night to push the damned light button to view the time. That's an issue.  Issue #3. Casio insists on incorporating the watch case into the band. That's true for this, for my Oceanus and for *all* of their watches. The good news, I suppose, is that it makes the watch fit the wrist a bit better but what it also means is that you cannot replace the strap/bracelet with anything else. That's obviously limiting but it's also an annoyance with *this* watch because the strap is not the most comfortable because it is thick, stiff and plastic resin. It's not exactly *un*comfortable, but it's still an unnecessary issue that they should fix.  Issue #4. Communicating the time: Anytime a watch offers complications on the dial, it necessarily makes it more difficult to read the time. Casio's solution is to make a negative display alternative for this watch (light on dark) for the subdials but the effect (from youtube reviews) is to make those subdials essentially unreadable. That's why I chose this version BUT, what I *didn't* notice, is that the right-side subdial is ringed in shiny silver, distracting further from the hands and making it *unnecessarily* difficult to read. Had they not done this -- and made this ring black as with the other two subdials -- this wouldn't be an issue.  Still, I like this watch. A lot. Don't *exactly* love it -- it certainly isn't a classic style and it won't be confused with a Casio Oceanus or other high-end watches -- but I keep coming back to putting it on my wrist and leaving my others (including a dreadfully-poor time-keeping Rolex, the Oceanus, and several much more expensive watches) in the drawer. Size is part of it, I think, as is the fact that it doesn't look like every other watch out there. The accuracy of this watch doesn't hurt, either; no other watch I have is more accurate including the Oceanus with its atomic time. Then, too, it is comfortable, all things considered, to wear: Despite its size (which is a feature for me) it's not heavy at all and the less-than-nice strap isn't *that* much of a problem.  Even though rationally (given its issues) I *shouldn't* favor it, the fact is I do. In a way I guess, its issues (as well as its look and its accuracy) make it kind of endearing and I'd buy it again."
4,"I like it. Automatic (self-winding) watches will make a big ... I like it. Automatic (self-winding) watches will make a big comeback because batteries are so expensive. As for this one, it seems to have a nice smooth movement and appears to be a quality timepiece. From the look and feel of it I'd be surprised if I didn't get years of good dependable service."
5,"Excellent wristwatch This is an outstanding timepiece that meets all of my expectations for a solid, dependable, stylish watch.  The Japanese movement has been flawless and it is keeping perfect time.  It is a very attractive watch that draws attention from people who notice it and ask if it's a Rolex.  For the money, this is an exceptional value."
5,"Best shoes ever Love love love these shoes. I have Achilles tendinitis and this is the first shoe I have worn that does not cause pain."
5,"Perfect Great watch"
5,"Great Product Great bra. Comfy."
5,"Superb! I researched several and loved the copper. Went elsewhere to buy as it was a little cheaper, but let me day... this is the sweetest microwave!!!! Extremely quiet. Stunning looks and power. Inside was small than my last, but in truth, I use to heat up coffee.. how big does it really have to be. Am in process of redoing kitchen and now I don’t have to figure out where to “hide” microwave. This is going to be on show!!!"
5,"What does the apocalypse and a $9 Amazon gift card have in common? Gorilla tape.  Cannibal test, mutant approved.  What's in the picture?  Gorilla tape, holding the completely broken passenger-side mirror of my Kia Optima firmly in place after my ex-wife introduced it to the wall of our apartment garage... So what's the big deal?  Well, the mirror weighs about 3-4 lbs and would otherwise hang freely from it's wiring. The Gorilla tape in the photo has held that mirror firmly in place for three years. That's three years in Dallas, Texas: Brutally hot humid summers, drowning in sunlight.  Traveling thousands of miles at tollway speeds against 65-75 mph headwinds. And yet, the tape still holds.  So well, in fact, that that I can still use the electric motor to position the mirror. The mirror has even gone three state safety inspections without comment."
5,"Very cute necklace I ‘m Absolutely in love with this necklace. You can wear three or just one . It’s very cute , and dainty . Sparkly and very stylish. You can make it shorter or longer. I would highly recommend it :) . It’s very nice as a gift as well"
5,"Five Stars My daughter loves these shorts... She wears them quite frequently!"
5,"Really big, stylish and useful everyday bag It fits everything that a I need for my daily needs, it is really big so maybe you should consider that if you're looking for a medium size backpack.  The quality is good and it feels secure, I'm really happy with my backpack"
5,"Air King Pro hood wall cap 6"" Perfect for what I've been needing.Strong,lightweight,and eazy too install."
5,"Best Bottle/Cup Brush When you deal with lots of bottles and straw cups you end up using the brush a lot of times. I love that you have different options that fit different bottles or straw cups."
5,"One and only bottle for breastfeeding!!! These are literally the ONLY bottles my breastfed baby will take.  We've tried comotomo, medela, avent, tommy tipee, nuk, boob, and more.  They were all met with disgust and screams. Not this one! Now if only lansinoh would make a pacifier, maybe she'd take that one, and save my pocketbook from trying every single one only to be met with rejection!"
5,"Soft and toasty So nice and soft and warm, and aren’t tight on my calves. Will be buying more!"
5,"Comfortable backpack Very satisfied with this back pack. I use it daily fits perfect for my 15"" laptop and all other accessories. Its very comfortable to carry."
2,"Not really for running. Seems a bit heavy. I used it for running and when sweating it fall out of my ear. Really annoying"
3,"Beware of misleading description We have only had this microwave 2 weeks but so far so good. We purchased this as much for its styling as its utility. We previously had an 1100 watt microwave. So this microwave takes a lot longer to make popcorn, heat up leftovers or melt butter. But for as little as we used our previous microwave being underpowered is not a problem. The description of its color is misleading, that’s why I knocked it down to 3 stars. The top and sides are cream colored. The door and control panel that everyone sees are white. I thought I was purchasing a cream colored microwave not a two ton d cream and white microwave. It will do for now until we can find a fully cream colored microwave."
3,"Horrible Straps/Hooks Nice bra. Good moderate compression. Purchased after a Post-Surgical Breast Lift. Ordered a large because I am a 36 C. There is one issue with this bra. The straps don’t stay connected. The loops the hooks go into are way to wide. This is more like a Breastfeeding Bra. Although the hooks are in the front, when putting the bra on (putting arms through the holes) the straps keep coming unhooked. So frustrating! I had to pinch the hooks closed with my teeth to prevent them from coming undone."
1,"Don't risk spilling your milk! I would recommend buying the regular caps that go onto the bottle.  These just slip in where the nipple would go and don't lock securely.  This means that it's easy to knock it out and lose/spill your milk."
4,"This is ok! This hoodie isn't bad! I liked the overall feel of the hoodie. It hit my hips like it is supposed to. Not too baggy, not too tight, the color is as advertised. Overall a good buy!"
4,"Filters are great, with one little tiny exception. I have purchased Chemex coffee filters in several styles (square, round, natural and bleached) and they are very dependable at brewing a fine cup of coffee. The only problem that I have found is that the Chemex pour over coffee carafe is not dufus-proof. I have dropped and broken two 10 cup carafes and I am not buying another one; not at $40 each with tax. So, now I have about 3/4 of a box of bleached round filters with nothing to pour through them. Maybe I can filter some peanut butter or something practical like that.  Otherwise, what a great product."
4,"Buy a size up Most buyers recommended sizing up.  I wear a 42 or 44 H in another brand underwire, non sports bra. I bought this in a 46 I. I don't need a non bounce bra or even a sports bra as walking is my main exercise. I needed a wire free bra because I heard some metal detectors don't like the wire and figured a sports bra would have more support. This fits fine but doesn't have the side support or lift as my regular wired bra. I'm also not a fan of the ""uniboob"" look, but it's no too noticeable. It's comfortable enough for a 10 hour day so I think a couple hours plane ride will be fine."
5,"Overall, Love Them! Pros: I really like the silky feeling of these shorts. Stays put through basic squats, lunges and deadlift motions. Unique color. Easy washing instructions. OCR workout durable. Cons: Not as compressing as I would prefer.  Overall I LOVE these shorts and would recommend them to people nedding the short workout shorts!"
5,"GO Dobie! One of these little guys is always by my sink.  Not too scratchy for nonstick, and really gets the job done."
5,"Great for travel The quality and durability of this bag is great. May favorite thing is that it's not giant, which forces me to pack less and therefore be able to easily slide it under an airplane seat. It keeps everything inside safe and in place too."
5,"A PERFECT ADDITION!!!!! I can't BELIEVE how awesome this blender is!!  I had a KitchenAid blender before and one of the parts broke on it.  I wasn't thinking that I could just replace the part (which was possible and was even offered on Amazon) so I ended up buying this blender and I'm so glad I did!  My most favorite feature is the blended drinks mode: The blades will start to blend for a few seconds and then stop and turn the other way to get the ice ""unstuck"", blend for a few seconds and stop, then spin the other way again.  It does that four or so times, just to make sure there are no chunks of ice left and you never have to stop the blender yourself to unclog the ice cubes from the bottom."
5,"Works as expected Good quality"
5,"Five Stars Bought for my dad and he loved it!!!!"
5,"Well-made; great price! Well-made, beautiful earrings! The price is great! The clasp is also quality and the size is perfect for everyday wear. Love these! Will probably buy all the colors."
5,"Love these leggings I love these leggings!!! I picked up a pair a while back from Marshals and was so surprised by how soft they were and was pleasantly surprised when I found them on amazon. I ordered them in the magenta color as well. I got a size small (5’4, 145lbs with hips and a booty). The ones I got from marshals are a medium and While they fit, I find myself pulling them up at the gym a lot so when I ordered them on here I sized down. They are a tiny bit tight but not uncomfortable. So so soft and comfortable and great colors!! I will be ordering more colors."
5,"My Favortie Watch I have probably purchased a dozen or so Seiko watches over the last 30 years and have been satisfied with them all and this one is no exception.  After several years of trying to find a good utilitarian watch, I  bought the SNK809 Seiko 5 watch and liked the ""atuomatic"" feature and the canvas strap...Extremely reliable but a little on the small side.  I was looking for something a little bigger, but not one of those that are currently in fashion with a face that even Stevie Wonder could read.  After buying the SNZG15, I have finally found the features I am looking for in a utilitarian military style watch. Reasonably priced, reliable, easy to read and comfortable."
5,"Great for Running I was chafing between my toes on long runs and these socks have stopped that from happening all together. They are quite durable and actually very comfortable to run in. The high heel prevents shoe rubbing on the achilles and once you get used to it, they aren't that hard to put on. Have gone on a few dozen run / wash cycles with them and have been very satisfied."
5,"Perfect HS backpack Son loves this backpack. Roomy without being bulky. Enough pockets to keep things organized. Great looks to be unique. So far it's durable for 5he daily academic haul.  We'll see how it performs on a 10-day, 4 country student excursion. Will post more details then."
5,"Seiko solar-what? Its Seiko?"
5,"Cute and functional Feels well made and I like the glass bottle. I definitely need to be careful not to drop this!! The blending function is powerful for a little thing, which I was surprised. I also liked the free ice tray that comes with this device. The ice cubes look smaller than I thought it would be, but it’s better for blending purposes. I can’t wait to make smoothies everyday since I’m constantly on the go."
2,"Weird sizing and fit! These run very big.. I usually wear a small-medium, never an xs, and the smalls we're big on me. In Nike leggings I wear small in all other Nike shorts I wear medium due to my butt and thighs. I got these because the reviews that claim they don't ride up, but the definitely did on me, and I only walked across the room! They were tight at the hem of the legs, yet loose in the crotch and upper thighs.. not sure how that works?? For reference I'm proportioned pretty evenly, while my thighs and butt are bigger and less toned than I want them to be, I don't exactly have thunder thighs or a ghetto booty. I wear a size 4 in American Eagle and Express.. a 6 in Abercrombie.. 26-27 in brands that size that way. Also these are way shorter than the 3"" Nike Pro Training shorts.. they are the best fit that I've found. I hope this helps! I only ordered these because I found ones with ""free returns"", I would have regretted it otherwise! Two stars because the material seems like it would hold up and the swoosh is embroidered instead of the usual print."
3,"Poor Noise Cancellation UPDATE to raise review to 3 stars.  I have tried the QC30 again based on a pair my co-worker purchased. The NC was much improved and I did a little research to see why this might have had happened. This is what I found from the Bose website about their new firmware update at the beginning of October:  ""With firmware version 1.3.6 comes a change in the Noise Cancelling performance of QC30.  The Noise Cancellation has been improved in the lower frequencies to make it more consistent with QC20’s performance.""  Based on this and my experience with my co-worker's set I purchased again and have taken them on several flights. They do now perform similar to the QC20i.  If this were my first time buying the QC30s I'd give it 4 or 5 stars. Since I feel they released the product prematurely and also didn't prepare their support staff for the release, I'm only going to raise my score to 3 stars.  ORIGINAL REVIEW  I have owned the QC25, 2 sets of the QC20i (I lost one set) and now the QC35. All have great noise cancellation and sound. I love the wireless convenience of the QC35. I was looking forward to the QC30 as a replacement for the QC20i. I found out from Bose support it’s not intended to be a replacement.  I fly between 60 to 90 times per year and rely on the noise cancellation. With all previous models, announcements, conversations around me and screaming babies weren’t a problem. That’s not the case with the QC30. On my 4 hour flight this week I could hear everything. The only way to drown out the kid 3 rows behind me was to turn the music up to full. I typically don’t play music but only leave NC on and work or read. That’s not possible with the QC30. I switched between the QC35 and QC30 and there is absolutely no comparison in NC. Switching between the QC20i and QC35 shows little or no difference in NC.  I called Bose support and they told me the QC30 was never intended to be a replacement for the QC20. They said the NC wouldn’t be as strong and wasn’t intended to be. That is why one is designated QuietControl and not QuietComfort. Which I thought was a totally bogus answer. That the QC30 was intended for people with the need for variable noise cancellation levels. I said I didn’t believe their marketing was clear on this.  I couldn’t be more disappointed. If you are expecting the NC level of the QC20i or QC25 or QC35, don’t expect it from the QC30."
1,"Failed on lightweight indoor application I hate giving one-star reviews but I was very disappointed in this mounting tape. I was having a hard time installing the valances that were included with some indoor vinyl blinds using the product's included clips. So I thought this exterior mounting tape would do the trick since my use is far from extreme. Each valance was lightweight and around 24"" inches long and 3"" wide - no clue on the weight but a matter of ounces, not pounds. The valances stayed up for several weeks but then one by one they came down. I followed the directions and both surfaces were clean and smooth so no idea why this mounting tape could not hold these light weight valances, which were never touched once they were installed. And they were never exposed to any harsh weather. So if this did not work under my very lame conditions I cannot see how it would work as advertised outdoors."
1,"Coming apart We purchased this backpack for travel. We’ve used it on 2 trips and the seam is coming apart. The backpack is in pristine condition and barely used but we are going to have to trash it. Based on the poor quality, I would not recommend this backpack."
1,"Save your money, buy another product. The whisk attachment works fine but the blender attachment is such a bad fit that it seems like it's the wrong one completely. Keeping it attached to the handle requires I hold it on so hard that my arm gets tired, which is saying a lot because I'm pretty strong. The rotation is so weak that it can even make bubbles in soapy water. Either mine is defective or it's just a piece of crap. I bought it to make mayo in a jar, but then ended up having to put it in a regular blender because after 10 minutes of blending with this device I still had streaks of loose oil that weren't even mixed in. I could have made better mayo blending with a fork."
4,"Comfy, Could be More Loose After reading the reviews, I ordered two sizes up from my normal size. I am curvy, with my hips being wider than my waist. I was hoping for loose, drapey, pants. These are pretty snug around my hips and butt. But they're extremely comfortable and I will be keeping them."
4,"HP print cartrages alwas work great. I have always purchased an HP printer and HP cartage's."
4,"Only okay I'm not sure how I feel about this tape; sometimes it seems to hold very well and sometimes not. Still have a few rolls to go before reordering, so I'll see if it's the way I use it first. Good value though!"
5,"College Freshman loves this bag... My daughter loves it...freshman in college...seems to be holding up pretty well...you can also wash the bag which is good because of the color."
5,"A very strong yet flexible Adhesive Quick-Repair Tape. This product simply out-performs plain old duct tape hands down. The fabric and, the adhesive seems much stronger than ordinary duct tape. I did notice that it doesn't particularly 'stick' well in ice cold conditions, but for warmer temps it out shines in every way,. I'll always keep a roll of Gorilla Tape on hand for those ""outdoor emergencies"". I used some Gorilla Tape on my plastic garbage can lids last spring, figuring I'd have to replace it within a couple of weeks due to the wet weather. Here it is the end of November with very cold (10F) temps, and it still holds strong, keeping out rainwater and containing the aroma (we have wild bears running about, and they have left it alone, knock on wood)."
5,"Nice Very nice and comfortable"
5,"Good Gear I needed a pack that would fit a Dell M-90, a pretty large 17"" laptop.  The options were fairly limited and I decided to try the Pegasus. It has turned out to be an excellent choice. I have taken it on several long trips. It has proven versatile, easy to carry, either wearing it as a backpack or carrying by the top handle.  The pockets give easy, quick and convenient access to contents, so I use it for my tickets, passport, etc. It easily holds and provides good protection for the M90 with room left over for accessories, files, books, etc. Highly recommend if you need a bag to carry a 17"" laptop."
5,"My new house shoes Love these! Had a pair of Adilettes years ago, and wore them until they cracked. Finally bought a new pair and they’ve updated them. So much more spongy than the old. Bought to wear around the house but now I need a pair for errands and beach."
5,"Still good choice at this price Everything else is good at this price. Only minor problem is that even i didn’t play any audio but I can hear some hzz sound. Is not complete quit when plugged into my computer."

The unit arrived in great shape, it was double boxed for protection and it is much more quiet than my last unit and I noticed that the rotary plate turns faster and smoother than my old unit too.  So all in all, I am very happy with this replacement unit.  I hope to get many years of service from this product."
5,"Convenient I’ve needed nose rings for a while and I’m happy I found this deal.  The ring kind of hurt but that might be do to the fact that I’ve had my nose ring out for a week and a half now."
5,"Great hiking backpack! I wanted to purchase a good backpack to hike with. Something durable, spacious, comfortable AND affordable. Cheap rather. This was a great purchase. I did a lot of searching and settled on this one for a few reasons. Look, design, both a chest strap and hip belt, size and price. It feels like very good quality, has plenty of room, handy pockets and straps to stick all your stuff in. Im 5'2 and when I first put it on, filled to the brim, the chest strap fell awkwardly on me but with a few adjustments of all the straps I was able to get it in the perfect position. It feels really well balanced and light even with 27lbs of gear in it. Great backpack overall. I might purchase another!"
5,"Great quality printer paper These cases of copy paper are excellent quality and work great in our printers. We continually order this product over and over."
5,"Great Work great, baby had no problem with them and the designs are cute."
2,"Get what you pay for: battery life cited is fraudulent, sorry Here's the thing about JLab products: they NEVER have the battery life they claim, and often the products cease to function within a year. I guess you get what you pay for since most other high-end wireless buds run 3-5 times what these do.  What they do well: 1. Fit. Compared to their wired buds, these fit really well in my ears and I have a hard time achieving fit. Nicely done. 2. Audio. clear and while the noise canceling is iffy sometimes depending on which silicone bud ends you use. The bigger ones cancel more but then the fit is off. I use the mediums and the cancellation isn't as advertised. That said, you get a full frequency range which other JLab products lack. 3. Case. It's nice. But remember to turn off the buds before you put them away or they will NOT recharge at all.  Not so well: 1. Cancellation. As mentioned above... get what ya pay for. 2. Battery life: Oh my these are just terrible. I'm waiting to see how long before they no longer work. I get an hour, not as advertised. That's it.  Given batt tech these days, this is just insufficient. If they weren't so cheap I'd send 'em back. If they fail completely in the coming months I'll return on principle. JLab: DO BETTER."
3,"Cheap lil chain It was a lot smaller and cheap feeling than I expected"
3,"Packaging issue They need to put the paper booklet on the outside of the bottle. By the time I got the paper out, the bottle was so scratched it looked used.  Not easy to remove at all. I tried scissors but it just cut so I had to use a butter knife to inch it out and I still had a hard time getting a grip.  45min later I got the 2 bottles removed from packaging and the insert removed.  So frustrating"
1,"Wrongfully sized product This item runs small, I ordered a 2xl and the size I received could fit a medium size person. The outfit is beautiful not up to my expectations of the product."
1,"Great System, Terrible with Adapters We've been using this for 9 months now and the only reason we didnt stop sooner was because we have already invested much into it.  It started out amazing using their nipples and all, but when our baby fed better with Dr. Browns nipples we needed an adapter. That adapter is the flaw and takes quite an effort for it to not leak. Twist too much, too little, etc it'll leak. Twist way too much and it'll snap off and retrying to attach it back to the bottle will cause even more leaks, making you need to get a new bag instead.  There's also a problem with a whole series of bags not attaching well to the adapter in which we have gotten the company to replace for us several times trying to make this system work for us.  Great System, but if you have to use their adapters for a different nipple, it's going to be very frustrating. It sucks when you think your child is drinking and instead milk is leaking all over the place at 3am in the morning, or if you're trying to replace a leaky bag only to find the next 5 bags don't seal well with the adapter. Avoid if you prefer other nipples."
4,"Decent paints for the cost These paints worked well for my daughter's painting projects.  The variety of colors is great and uses less than mixing fewer colors together to make one color.  Worked well on canvas."

5,"Durable French Press My husband makes his coffee via French Press every single morning, and unfortunately we have broken two of the glass reservoirs for the Bodum French Press. I surprised him with this stainless steel press, and he is extremely pleased thus far. The carafe holds double the amount that his Bodum held, and we are thrilled to have something that will last us longer than 6 months! He was also excited to see the included jar that can hold any extra grounds. The press itself is very appealing and looks great on our counter."
5,"Does NOT work with IPHONE 11...yet These earbuds arrived quickly and were just as promised. They connected easily to multiple phones in my household and sounded good. However, they did NOT work with the iPhone 11s, which is what the teen that wanted them had.   I posted this question on Amazon, since apparently the only mention of the issue is found in microscopic print under one picture in the description (I had to screenshot and enlarge it to see this). To my surprise, within a few days, the seller responded directly with an explanation, so bonus points for the seller. When they are updated to work with the newest iPhone, I may buy again. For now, I've returned them (which was also super easy @ Kohl's)."
5,"Pumping mama Works great, I use it 5x a day. A bit noisey and the plate can be a pain to get clean but all in all I love it and would recommend it."

5,"Colorful Selections I love that these are made of Cotton!  I'm tired of flimsy blouses that you need to layer - like put on clothes to wear clothes.  That said, this selection, no matter what color your flimsy outer-blouse is, you will find a match in this selection, for either work or play!  And they're washable!"

5,"Wow Love them."
5,"Great Headphones for the Price! Guys - awesome set of headphones!  I love, love, love wireless ear buds and every time I see a good deal, I will snag them.  I gave this pair to a friend as a birthday gift and he loves them!  Great sound quality, way better battery life than other more expensive brands, and they don't fall out exercising.  Excellent pair of wireless ear buds for yourself or if you need a unique and useful gift for someone.  Oh, and they are GREAT for travelling.  Small case with long battery life to watch movies or shows with really good noise cancellation to drown out crying babies."
5,"Sounds good to me The sound quality of these earbuds is as good as any I own, (at least I can't tell the difference).  I just wanted a basic headset without spending too much and these seemed like a good value. Pairing was easy with my Samsung Galaxy S8 Android phone as well as my Leeco phone. The music controls are easy to adjust and the magnetic buds make it easy to store and hang these when not in use. I like them."
5,"Good value and pretty Love these earrings, they came in a nice box and were sturdy with  nice shiny silver with a beautiful white pearl.  The silver hook is a little thicker in the middle but didn't hurt at all when I put them on and they stay in place without moving at all. For the money and what I needed them for (church) I thought they were a good deal!"
5,"Roomy and great for college backpack! Works great. I use it for school everyday. Carry a book and laptop and notebooks and other school essentials and it’s still in good condition. I had it for about 2 months now. Not sure how long it’ll last. I’ll do an update in a few months."
2,"Not Generously Fitting as Expected from Hanes I gave these two stars for the fit:  I've been a huge fan of the Hanes brand and wear their full length knit pants and shorts like crazy.  I assumed this pair of capris would be the same but NO.  Compared to six other pairs of Hanes I own, these fit ""somewhat small,"" as the others have a more relaxed and generous fit.  Not these.  These cling with little give to them. Maybe I'll try again in the spring..."
3,"Great size pencil But the erasers come off easily, would not purchase again These wider pencils were great for gripping with smaller hands. Unfortunately, the during the first use of the eraser, the entire eraser pulled out of the pencil. I thought it was a fluke, but then the same thing happened to the other three pencils!!  This seems like a poor design. I was grateful for the included pencil sharpener as we did not have one already that was the correct size. However I would not buy these again because of the erasor problems"
1,"USELESS for oversize packages -  ALL the hallmarks of poor design! This has the distinct feel of an item with a poor design whose short-coming was caught late in the development process and was remedied with a quick-fix that is hampered by the product’s own design.  Allow me to elaborate:  There is a Hold feature that is supposed to hold the measurement when the readout is obscured by the item being weighed.  Due to the low-profile, upward facing read out and small surface area (about one-half-square-foot), it doesn’t take much to hit that mark.  HOWEVER, the scale can’t automatically hold the measurement: you have to push a button on the side.  But since the thing’s only one-and-a-half inches tall, just imagine trying to fit your hand under there, without jiggling to item, to press the button!  INSANE.  So, yeah, here’s how I imagine the process went:  “We made a great, low profile scale!” “WOW!  Wait.  I can’t see the read out.  And when I pick the item up, the scale zeroes out.” “We’ll add a button to hold the measurement!” “Great!  Put it into production!”  Don’t bother with this unless you’re measuring items smaller then that surface area of the scale."
1,"Not what I expected! I was excited for these as I had heard good things, the quality was not what I expected and neither was the sizing."
4,"Not really duct tape but useful I used some of this temporarily on the roof of my RV and also on some metal flashing on my house roof that was leaking.  In both cases there was no UV damage to the back of the tape, but the adhesive gave up all stickiness in a few months sun.  I can't imagine that it would fare much better on heating system ducts.  If it's on the outside of the duct insulation it might be okay, but I think a hot attic would have about the same effect as the sun on a white rubber membrane RV roof (i.e., that does not get all that hot).  Use aluminum foil tape on ducts.  Us this indoors an on things that don't get too hot."

These have the flat back but go in just like a normal earring. I have very sensitive ears and I haven't had any discomfort, tenderness, or seepage from these. I've worn them for two to three weeks straight so far, through showers and all. I pull on them every once in a while to make sure there's still no tenderness, and there still isn't!! For reference I have three earlobe piercings on each side and the three smallest sizes fit perfect."
5,"High quality just smaller than I thought it would be. I bought this for a trip to Europe and ended up returning it because it didn't have the capacity I thought it would.  That said, it was a really high quality bag and I would've kept it if I didn't have other bags in a similar size."

5,"Great pants! I love these pants! For reference, I'm about 209, 5'7, 43inch hips. I usually wear a 16-18 and carry a lot of wight in my lower belly. I ordered a 3XL with the hope that these wouldn't be tight on my stomach and they weren't! The fabric would have definitely been clingy had I ordered a smaller size so go up a size or two if you aren't wanting them to be clingy. The fabric is super soft and they are light enough to wear in warmer weather. I got the black and they weren't see through at all. They were a little long but being 5'7 this wasn't much of an issue. Would definitely purchase again."

Our office recently got new wall calendars and everyone was trying to figure out how to hang them.  We tried using everything from clear tape to painters tape and everything eventually fell off the walls.  I remembered my teachers used to use this stuff on the cinder block walls of the school and things would stay up all year, so I thought I would give it a shot.  It has held my wall calendar up with no problems and my co workers are trying to figure out what I did (i haven't told them my secret yet)  Highly recommend this product for hanging stuff on walls when you don't want to leave a bunch of holes everywhere."

3,"A little disappointed since this is the 3rd box of ""Velcro"" brand ... These are okay. I have a hard time keeping up a projector screen with these and end up using duct tape more often than not. The sticky backing seems to separate from the harder 'hook' side quite often. Leaving the sticky part on the surface (frame) and the fastener still attached to the loop side. A little disappointed since this is the 3rd box of ""Velcro"" brand that I purchased that has done this."
3,"Get what you paid for, good for podcasts not great for music. You get what you pay for with these. Sound quality isn't completely awful but if you care about sound quality on music go for a another pair. The headphones themselves feel bigger than they are, they don't stick out much when you wear them. Battery life is also very good, either the battery lasts longer than the advertised 3 hours or they charge very quickly, the battery is still pretty good even after a full 8 hour shift of constantly listening and only charging on break and lunch. The case is small but kinda bulky and the build feels a bit cheap. it's also difficult to tell if the USB cable is plugged in right since the charging light in the back doesn't change when you plug the cable in. All in all they're great for listening to podcasts or YouTube videos while working, not so good for music tho."
1,"Ripped in less than 2 months. Bought for my son in high school. He has used it for 7 weeks and it ripped.

4,"It is very light weight and portable which is nice since I move it back and forth from the ... My hand is so thankful for this triumphal trimmer!  As a homeschooling mom, having a paper cutter is a lifesaver.  I used to have a little slide rule cutter, but I find this trims the edges much smoother than the slide cutter.  It is very light weight and portable which is nice since I move it back and forth from the garage (this mama is paranoid about having a guillotine in the house with small children).  It can cut through a decent amount of papers, though I try not to cut too many at the same time, and it cuts easily through laminated card stock which is what I most wanted it to do well.  I knocked it down one star because it does occasionally bend the edge and have difficulty cutting some of my laminated edges if they are pretty short (meaning only a little excess is hanging over the side to be cut off).  Also, I have a hard time figuring out the latch lock, and that's a BIG deal to me.  Mine doesn't really click solidly or anything to let me know that it's definitely locked.  I have thought it was locked, did a light test, picked up the cutter to get ready to move it to the garage, and tested the handle again only to find it had unlocked itself.  I have common sense and troubleshooting abilities and have given it an earnest try to find some sure way to get it to lock securely the first time each time, but I still have not succeeded.  So I just do like the ""measure twice; cut once"" adage and check multiple times until I feel a little more confident it really is locked.  All that to say, it's a great, affordable little trimmer that does what I need it to do pretty well.  I just would really be sure you are storing it somewhere that is very safe and out of reach if you have small children in your home."

I get compliments and funny looks for wearing it all the time. ""That's an old-school watch!"" Yeah! I gotz no time to waste, places to go, people to see.

After wearing these for 1 day I threw my galaxy buds and my bose soundsport free ear buds in my bag. These are more comfortable than both. They stay in your ear better than the galaxy buds. The sound quality is crisp for any genre. For wireless earbuds the bass is remarkably defined and really good. I have tried nearly all ear buds on the market that are $120+ and these are definitely all around better than all I have tried due to being comfortable, stable in your ear, good battery life, stable in the case, and controls."
5,"Love it, will order more in the future. I’m allergic to sunscreen, the ingredients in them cause me to get itchy red welts and/or hives after exposed to the suns UV rays. It’s gotten to a point where I had my eyes swollen shut after I applied sunscreen on my face. Trying to prevent getting burnt/tan is hard to do and expensive since I’ve found that the closest thing I can wear on my skin for sun protection is middle to high end makeup foundations such as M*A*C or MUFE. So it gets expensive!!!  Reading over the reviews I went and ordered a laege and it fits perfectly the way I wanted it to be, not too tight or too loose. I’m a 36C/34C, 27 waist/39 hips. I like how cool it feels on and how it’s protecting me from the sun. Definitely would order more in the future BUT hoping to get more colors since I’m not a fan of pastel colors. Black, grey and white are great but if I could get deeper reds, blues and dark greens that would make it even better. Same with the men’s shirts as well."
5,"Clear skin I am 33 and have had an extremely dry forehead for a few years. I could slather it with lotion several times per day and it'd still be dry. It did not produce its own oil.  I recently started breaking out with severe cystic acne on my neck and jawline. It was out of control. I started taking Vitex and within a few days I noticed that my forehead was slightly oily, I can now just use a small amount of lotion and it's fine. My acne started drying up, and now there is almost nothing left.  I have read that Vitex reduces breast pain. It actually increased my breast pain. I used to get very sore, lumpy breasts before my period in my mid-late 20s. I kind of missed it and I'm glad its back.  Anyway, Vitex definitely does something, and it is noticeable and the effects start immediately. Its a powerful substance. Highly recommend if you have jawline acne and a dry forehead.  Downside, it causes a slight headache and possibly mild depression. Those effects have been less noticeable over time. Because of this, I only take one pill, every other day. Taking two pills per day, as recommended seems far too strong."
2,"Not cut for women. Gap at crotch, tight on thigh ,huge at waist Not cut for women.  Feel like men's pants , went up a size , tight in thighs and hips , huge at waist , when stop body from ability to bend.  Huge gap at crotch ..size down should of fit but we're too straight cut ...tired of 'Womens' being cut for people with zero curve. Wtf . Should of expected it made in another country ."
3,"Need metal cutting place on a dispenser You cannot use this on a plastic Scotch tape dispenser.  You can only cut this tape on metal.  It's an added expense but it has to happen that way."
1,"The stem was too short and I could not get a good grasp so it took 10-20 minutes to pull it ... First time user and it was an awful experience. The stem was too short and I could not get a good grasp so it took 10-20 minutes to pull it out. IDK if I'll try a different one but this one definitely doesn't work for me."
1,"Good design, VERY POOR QUALITY - DO NOT travel with this bag While I had read others reviews, and saw the issue with the broken zipper, but I assumed they filled it too much, or treated it harshly.  On day 1 of a 2 week trip the main zipper broke.  So it was useless.  But I lugged it around with me for 2 weeks so I could return the junk."
4,"These are exactly what I needed They are easy to turn on and connect to my phone.  The sound quality is really good and sound is very easy to adjust.  Very pleased."
4,"Works better then rags or papertowels This has proved to be very helpful keeping my stainless appliances clean and fingerprint free.  Works better then rags or papertowels."
4,"Good Quality Sock I am please with these socks, they fit as expected and seem to be made of good quality material.  I have worn them several times, they offer light compression and are comfortable all day long.  I would defiantly buy more in the future."
5,"Exactly what I expected Exactly what I expected"
5,"Great to have on hand! Works as described."
5,"love this purchase i loved these shirts so much i now have 5. they are so soft and comfy. I would size up to what u normally wear. I read the other reviews and went with a large instead of a medium and it fits perfect. Looks great with jeans by itself or using as a layered look with a vest on top of it. highly suggest."
5,"comfortable Love the smart wool. Keeps feet dry."
5,"My favorite watch. Had it 4 months and I hate taking it off. Easily adjustable, I stopped wearing all my other watches I love this one so much."
5,"Steal for the price. I wore the white one to the gym today and it fit me really good. I quite like the product and for $10 it's a steal. I do medium cardio like treadmill and biking so the pair does give me good support. I would highly recommend these for ladies who are into low and medium level workouts. I ordered a size 38. I generally wear a 36 C bra but as these are bralets, it's better to order a size up."

5,"Best G-Shock for my money Best G-Shock for my money, period. it looks awesome on my wrist and is perfect size. Not too big and yet not so small. I have not taken it off since I purchased here a few months ago. I have been looking for the perfect G-Shock since last September when I bought my first on a cruise (yes, over-priced) and have purchased 3 since but this is the one I was really seeking. the others sadly remain in my watch box with little or no play. By the way I own 1 Rolex, 5 Seiko's, 4 G-Shocks and 2 Charmex stainless models but this one is the schnizzle. Love the auto light feature. this really has everything I need and want and no BS. I may sell my 8 year old Rolex very soon."

5,"Well it's glass! it's durable unless you drop it! that's why I had to buy one...I broke the one that came with the coffee maker. Thanks for the opportunity to have a replacement."
2,"Not as represented They were red on the site but pink in reality. Didn’t match the outfit."
3,"Nice but not as expected It depends upon what you are looking for. They are very pretty but they are a bit on the small side, definitely not oval as pictured and described, these are oblong shaped.  If you are of light skin, blond coloring, they will blend in and cannot really be seen.  This pair was obviously worn and returned, even the inside case was dirty, dusty, crushed enough that one earring had come loose.  Pair had to be returned, not reordered, simply because they are not what we'd been expecting. Plus, they could have cleaned up the inside of the box a bit. Euu."
3,"Okay As a teacher,  I need presharpened pencils. I can't have ten kids in line trying to sharpen pencils and avoid work.  The Amazon basics are ok, but the points could be better. They don't resharpen too easily. Why can't Amazon offer better prices for teachers who have $0 budget and use their own money?"
1,"Moldy bra! I was insulted to receive a bra with mold and other disgusting damage"
1,"Box is disappointing Not impressed with the variety"
4,"Amazing watch with a stiff band This is my third Timex Expedition (over a long period of time, though, so don't take that as a complaint about the durability!) I regularly use the dual time zone feature, one or more of the three alarms, the timer, the stopwatch, and the Indiglo backlighting. I like that the buttons and settings have always been the same, so I can pretty much use my go-to features without even looking. No surprise I liked the Timex Expedition better than any other sports watches I looked at when I needed a replacement.  I chose one with a fabric band because I've had trouble with a Velcro replacement band snagging my clothes. But the fabric band is stiffer than previous models, and the loop that holds the excess band is quite small. I find it takes quite a bit of dexterity to put it on and secure the excess strap. I'm hoping it will break in and achieve the more comfortable fit I'm used to."
4,"Great I bought my wife a necklace for our anniversary, but the sterling silver chain caused an allergic reaction. This gold chain was the perfect solution."
4,"Helps with odor I’ve always suffered from yeast infections and B.V; going to the doctor and getting prescriptions became too much of a hassle so I decided to try these. They work great for odor but will not treat yeast infections. If you suffer from yeast infections, you could try limiting your sugar and starch intake. I had to give up carbs and sugar after the colon hydro therapist informed me that I had the worst case of candida she’s ever seen."
5,"This is PERFECT. However I was hoping to find a sweat jacket that would replace another that I have that is wearing out.  This is PERFECT.  However, I think I should have gotten the 2X instead of the 3X.  The 3X is really big.  I got it because when I end up washing it, I was thinking it would shrink up a bit.  Hopefully it does.  Either way, it's nice and soft and great for morning walks in this California weather, ha!"
5,"Excellent! Excellent"
5,"Under Armour This was very easy to order. It came in the perfect size. Speedy delivery."
5,"Love Love it !!!"
5,"This is a great looking watch This is a great looking watch.  My son loves it and receives a lots of compliments all the time. Is big, so, small wrists beware,,, A must buy..."
5,"Best travel backpack ever! Best travel backpack ever! This is very versatile, offers a ton of space, and allows for great organization of your items. The extra pockets at the top and on the outside allow you easy access to items that you need to get to quickly. I love that you can change the strap and make it a bag rather than a backpack."
5,"Blue light kettle Something makes your life cooler in a hot way. Love the LeD light at the side and the price is really great"
5,"This tape is FANTASTIC Ok, who would think tape would be good enough for a review? Well this tape is. It goes above and beyond on almost every level. Super strong, doesn't rip while you are using it leaving you picking at it with your finger nail like so many cheap tapes. This stuff never rips and you can restart. Crystal Clear so you can cover bar codes (at least we have been able to without any problems- do this at your own risk but we have never ever had a problem because its so clear). The only thing we feel is that this tape is so good you might not need quality this high. Kind of like using premium resume paper: you don't always need it. Also it is a little harder to pull off the roll but you can relax while pulling as hard as you want because it's not going to break.  Over all this is super high quality tape."
5,"Very pretty for the price. I bought this for my daughter. She really appreciated it. She doesn't wear it all the time, but it's holding up well 2 months out."
5,"Easy to handle.. The bag handles all of my items for work."
5,"I bought this product again; it is working just fine. Good value for your money. I am using this product with other therapies as well. Seem to be working well."
5,"Perfect This style of Champion sports bra I've used successfully many years and I'm glad I purchased it again. Fits me well in a Medium. At the same time, I also ordered the more supportive Absolute Working Sports Bra, also in Medium, and I sent it back because it was much too tight, more like a Small. I l love this sports bra even though it's supposed to be less supportive. I'm a 36C and prefer the natural and not as restrictive a feel that other sports bras have. This sports bra offers enough support for me."
5,"Exactly what I was looking for I love them exactly what I was looking for good quality thank you fornthe fast shipping 😊"
2,"Not as described! This is not boxes of 10, it's a loose case of 60!  In our case, we now have to repackage in plastic bags, leaving the product open to crushing (more than they were in the box - partially crushed upon receipt - but without damage to the k-cups)."
3,"try it your project might be different It might work for everyone else but didn't work for me, and don't get me wrong I have loved all their products and the new tape outstanding I am not telling you not to try it just didn't work on this project, and I'm getting old"
1,"Price isn’t everything On my second 100 count since Christmas when I got my new coffee maker. My first 100 count was great all 100 great taste and aroma. this second 100 count NOT so the coffee has a almost bitter old aroma and taste about the same. Just to make sure it wasn’t on my end I dumped the water reservoir and made sure everything was clean and then flushed a cup of hot water through and made my final cup with the same results. The best by date was 12/19 which is 9 months away so I can only figure it wasn’t stored properly or just a bad batch. I think for now I will buy where I can check the date regardless of price. Will be sending it back to amazon"
1,"Horrible quality I wore this for less than an hour and it broke in half. The quality of the ring is horrible and it is not sterling silver. It is plastic and not stamped to verify that it’s sterling silver."
4,"Great mid-line earbuds! I listen to a lot of on-line talk radio and deal with a lot of telephone calls - these are GREAT for both of those uses!  My box came with 5 extra sets of pads so that I can customize the buds to my ears instead of being stuck between two sizes like other sets.  I like that this headset has the a control ""pad"" that allows you to control the volume, answer and end calls and works well with an mp3 player.  Listening to music, however, is a little different - they sound a little ""tinny"" and the bass is not as deep as I would like - BUT for the price, this is a great headset!"
4,"Great value for lightweight, comfortable AirPod alternative.  Touch interface could be improved. I use these wireless, in-ear headphones for both music and podcasts.  Pros: - The product is packaged nicely and includes the headphones, a charging case, a micro-USB cable to charge the charging case, and a velvet bag to carry the charging case. - The charging case has a nice finish and is fun to play with.  When you place each headphone near its charging area, a magnet draws it into the proper charging location in a way that feels like magic.  The headphone lights up momentarily to indicate that it is charging.  Very little effort is required start the lid closing.  Then it snaps shut in the same satisfying way a Motorola flip phone did in 2006. - I love that the charging case can also be used as portable USB charger to charge other devices.  What good are headphones if your phone's battery is dead?  I used this like a daisy-chain to charge my phone and the case from a single power supply. - The headphones pair quickly with each other and paired easily with my phone over Bluetooth. - The touch interface on the headphones is very convenient for playing/pausing the sound while my phone is not in my hand.  Cons: - In quiet surroundings, I find the volume of the headphones is too loud, even at my phone's lowest possible volume setting above silent. - The touch interface can be frustrating to use because there is no audible or haptic feedback to indicate the headphone has registered my tap.  For example, I tap once on the earbud to start the music.  Sometimes the music starts right away, but sometimes it doesn't start at all.  Then, I wonder is the earbud on?  Has the battery died?  Did I tap the earbud at the wrong place or not hard enough?  This could be improved if the earbud would beep when it registers a tap."
5,"Such a great size for pumping &amp; storing! What a game changer for pumping! I was using the smaller bottles that held just under 3 oz each, but those overflowed so many times, especially when I was overtired at first. Also, if you’ve ever had to pump on the road, you know it’s a pain to switch collection bottles...something you can nearly avoid with these. Using these has been such a great change...I wish I used these from the start!"
5,"Must have wireless earbuds I have tried different earbuds including high-end ones. The Boltune Bluetooth V5.0 does a great job keeping up with them. It has really good sound quality/noise cancellation, it's light weight, comfortable to use and affordable ($). In my opinion this is a very good product and definitely a strong option to consider. It can also be a great gift."
5,"Works good These work good. No complaints"
5,"Keeps you nice and warm. Perfect fit and used most days while on vacation."
5,"My favourite flavor/blend of coffee from the Nespresso VertuoLine coffees My favourite flavor/blend of coffee from the Nespresso VertuoLine coffees. Smooth flavor and not to strong, but not weak or watery either. Just right and mixes wonderfully with a splash of soy creamer."
5,"Life saver They were packed perfectly and I was grateful to not have to chase them down in the stores since my grandson likes to chew the nipples."
5,"Go ahead buy them.  They are regular file folders. They are regular files folders.  They work like regular file folders."
5,"Perfect gift for anyone for any occasion The bracelet is exactly as described in the descriptions and pictures. It is beautiful and sparkly. It comes in a nice box perfectly ready to present as a gift. This would be the perfect gift to get for anyone for any kind of occasion. It's so pretty that it can to worn at all times. This piece of jewelry is very easy to match with any kind of clothes, from jeans and a simple top to a very fancy evening dress. I love how its adjustable so anyone can wear it. I would recommend this gift for anyone looking for a beautiful yet affordable bracelet for their love one. Afterall, who doesn't like beautiful sparkling jewelry?"
5,"Awesome Watch As an Avid outdoorsman I like some of the features this watch offered. Not only does it look great, but the compass and Barometer really come in handy in the field. I love this watch and would highly recommend it for those who love The outdoors."
5,"great fit good quality jogger pant This was a risky purchase for me as I don't typically buy clothes on Amazon.  I saw these and thought it couldn't really go wrong given the return policy.  I'm glad I purchased these.  They actually look very similar to a pair of designer jogger pants I have that were considerably more expensive. So far the quality has held up well to washing.  I am 5'4"" and 145lbs these were a great length for me. I like my sweats to be baggy so I purchased the large."
5,"excellent for 1st microscope my grandson loves this.  7th birthday.  everything you need in one kit.  think his mom was more excited than him and she's a dr."
5,"THE INTIMIDATOR To be honest this watch is big and my wrist is not small. The band is nice and works well with the watch.  It looks great all the way aroundand as of now it's definitely a keeper."
5,"Love different sizes! Love the different styles and sizes! So far so good!"
2,"Earrings Flattened &amp; some post were bent during shipping There were a couple pairs that were just decent quality, but overall the metal material used in making these are all very thin &amp; very cheap looking especially for ladies with very short hair as the earrings will all stand out more and be seen more as opposed to ladies with longer hair."
3,"Lines are too small, found a better one Lines are too small.  A standard register used to have 24 double-lines (one gray, one white), per open page; 12 on both sides of the middle. It's hard to find them in banks anymore.  These are OK, again, really small if you like to use the gray space for a memo or the show the addition/subtraction (double entry method).  I just ordered checks from Costco and they have the registers that have 24 lines per page (instead of these which have 32) and they're great.  They are $3.90 for a 2-pack or $7.80 for a 4-pack for regular members.  For Executive members, they're 20% off that and all are free shipping. The registers can be ordered separately, you don't have to order their checks.  It's worth it to me to finally find them instead of asking at the bank.  I ordered two 4-packs, should last a long time; I can easily read these, and the three-year calendar is current."
1,"It works for a little while Don't buy...waste of money"
1,"Looks FAKE! Be aware Awful! Does not look like in the picture, and I doubt it's women size. It seems FAKE! Even the shape at the bottom looks weird."
4,"Nice yoga tights I'm 5""1 with an average inseam(29-30""), 30"" waist and 41"" hips, and the medium size fits well. (If you require tall-length pants they will be too short, or if you have a long torso you might find the rise too short.) Like some other customers I do find there to be a bit of extra fabric around the ankles. It's not bothersome, but I did deduct one star because it's weird with my socks. I plan on purchasing at least one more pair. I find the plum does not have show-through, but I would not recommend buying a tighter size to ""look cute"" as I think it would stretch the fabric too much and cause show-through. My biggest criticism, other than the ankle fabric, is the pocket could be deeper. It holds my 7th gen iPod sideways with the headphone plug at the top of the pocket. I hope these are a Lightning Deal again."
4,"perfect size for toddler It is a perfect size for toddler and my granddaughter loved it."
4,"Comfortable basic leggings with stretch I'm in between sizes and actually got both large and medium. Large is comfortable, lounge feel. The medium is more form fitting around my waist (not a problem if you're not packing extra pounds there which unfortunately I am) and generally more fitting overall but still wearable with legs fitting better than the top portion for me personally. I would probably wear the medium with a long tunic to cover the top portion. The large is more lounge-like/less form fitting and I could get away with a mid-hip top."
5,"G-shock without the sticker shock! This watch is exactly what I was looking for. It fits great! The white on black numbers are actually a good contrast. And you can enable the back light to automatically come on with a tilt of the watch (from 1-3 seconds). The rest of the features are outstanding of course - solar powered, atomic clock syncing, alarms, stop watch, count down timer. And it's able to track phases of the moon and tidal patterns. I'd highly recommend it for anyone looking for a g-shock in a complete blackout."
5,"Perfect! I am renting a home and did not have the luxury of putting in a proper vent through the roof. I was hesitant to use a non-ducted hood but for the price I thought it was worth the try. This hood looks great, works great, and makes cooking meats on the stove top so much more enjoyable!  The hood has cut down on grease on the floor, smoke throughout the entire house when searing, and even heat spreading through the house in those warm summer months (it pushes the warm air towards the bathroom where I can vent it out...may not be applicable to everyone)! The light is a great addition as it illuminates the work surface well. The attention to detail is superb; by this I mean, the corners are angled so that when you are standing to the side of the stove, you do not risk hitting your head on the hood.  The switches are a bit high for my 5'2"" wife. I don't see how this could have been resolved, though, and is likely common to all hoods."
5,"good This looks good. Look forward to the juice"
5,"Nice fabric I like it a lot, fits decent and not too big on me."
5,"High quality and comftable Pairing them to a device was simple and easy and the range of the Bluetooth connection is great. The headphones are very comfortable and sit securely in the ear. The battery lasted several hours of full use (as advertised) and the sound quality was surprisingly good with no apparent lag when watching videos. The charging case is very well built: compact and durable."
5,"Just what I was looking for Works great!"
5,"Purchase of the year for me! Love this backpack!  I have had it for several months.  I have to park and walk abt a half mile to work each day and am a smaller gal, it fits my purse, laptop and lunch bag @ minimum and I am able to carry it on my back comfortably.  Distributes the weight perfectly.  Would recommend for sure.  Other co-workers have purchased as well and love it."
5,"smell is okay it cleans good"
5,"Quick, easy, and works great Does just want it needs to do. I use a bottle to pour in the 7 oz of water, stock it up with the items I want to sanitize (bottles, breast pump parts, pacifiers, etc.), microwave it for 4 minutes, and let it sit for 2 before opening it up. It’s obviously super hot when it’s first done and of course steam comes out when you open it so you have to be careful and wait a beat before unloading it, but it’s all a really easy process. I’m a first time parent so doing this after washing the items just gives me an extra sense of safety before using them."
5,"We Love NUK!!! Always loved nuk products and now that I have my own child they are my number one baby company. My son needs cereal in his formula due to his acid reflux. He had NUK bottles before the doctor recommended Doctor Brown bottles and I had to expand all the wholes in the nipples :/ Than I seen these with medium flow and the wholes are perfect &lt;3"
5,"Easy directions to maximize your labels I like this product because I used to never get the labels in the right direction after using and wanted to add more information. But this product came with instructions and labels have marks to insert the label sheet in the right direction."
5,"Rael Cotton pads won’t cause jock-itch I love how I was able to identify which pads worked best for my body type, given the selection provided by the value pack. I immediately noticed less itching and redness between my thighs; this was a major issue with common brands. I no longer get jock-itch from pads causing too much humidity because of the unnecessary plastic. I love the material, texture, and sensitivity to my precious flower."
5,"The best! Awesome erasers!! As with all hi-polymer erasers, they need to stay in the cardboard jacket and be properly used to avoid them breaking. My kindergartener loves these and uses them daily with no issues at all. They erase with ease and are even effective on colored pencils and crayons to a certain degree."
2,"Somewhat defective. I like the design, but the second hand doesn't match the second markers.  Disappointed."
3,"Get what you pay for... The light trick is inverted"
3,"Great shoe, but needs a little more soul in the sole! Go a half size up if you use running socks.  I loved these shoes, but for some reason -the way they were made- the bottom corner of the soles wear out very quickly. Had the same problem with the levitate ones."
1,"Underarmor either using cheap material or cutting corner when manufacturing. I'm sadly disappointed in underarmor for the quality and material being used.  Or perhaps it is the manufacturer sewing of ur products.  Something has definitely changed! I would shop at all your stores for our boys buy had to buy size13-14 for their dad.  He would go at keastba year before having to replace all his socks. This pack lasted only 1 month before all the elastic was coming out of sock like frays covering the whole bottom from heels to toes.  Grrr now which company should I buy from?"
1,"Not a low flow nipple My son gulped down bottles with these and had excessive gas."
4,"Really good product I like this product, on my second bottle."
4,"Bottles pictured are not bottles I received The bottles in the picture are not the bottles I got. The ones in picture have the measurement marks painted on. The ones I got have clear, raised measurements so it’s hard to tell how much is in the bottle without looking very closely."
4,"Absorbent. Did hold up better than my store brand!"
5,"Fine. I prefer these to other nipples. I have Evenflo glass bottles which fit many different bottle caps. I've used the Medela nipples which I really just don't like and have also used Evenflo winged nipples which I didn't like, they collapsed and leaked when we used them. These are simple and get the job done. My son is never very gassy and rarely spits up."
5,"5 stars Five star item.  These ear buds are great! I got them a couple weeks ago but just recently tried them out.  Ladies! These are perfect for watching yt videos or listening to music while doing or getting your hair done.  No wires in the way. ASMR lovers. I use These at night time for going to sleep to asmr videos...no more wires in bed.  These also have great audio quality.  The bass from nicki minajs new megatron song sounds great with these. UPDATE month later. Finally used in gym. Not the greatest at staying in my left ear for some reason.  Only other wish for these is i wish that the volume controls were on them other than that great item"
5,"Comfort Great sweatshirt......especially for the price.  Wish I bought more"
5,"Great drying rack. This drying rack is awesome! First its nice to look at. I leave it out on the counter as it takes no space at all. I love how i can move the pieces around if i need more room or move them closer together for other items. Its also easy to wash. Its also sturdy for those glass bottles. I use the comotomo bottles and they fit perfect."
5,"Five Stars Great selection of brushes. Easy to clean. Comes in all shapes and sizes."
5,"GREAT COFFEE GREAT PRICE TASTES LIKE HEAVEN. I got the Caramel flavored coffee and it is amazing. What a great tasting coffee for the price! Will definitely be ordering again!"
5,"Nice and sturdy. So far, I’m happy. They are petite, they look classy. They have not changed color yet and I have been wearing them for a week. It’s nice to see a product that is not overpriced. The rose gold is a pretty color. They have a nice strong  closing sound. Hopefully they won’t turn color. I will definitely order more products if these earrings  stand up."
5,"Nighttime pads be gone! This has been a life changer. Yeah, there’s a learning curve in the beginning. I had one major leak, but it was totally my fault and it was my heaviest day. Other than that one mishap, I really haven’t had any other issues at all. Sleeping has been the best part of buying the Saalt cup. Pads were always annoying and I had leaks all the time because I move so much in my sleep. Let me tell you, if you hate pads and wearing/taking out tampons annoys you, you’ll love this. Be warned, it is messy when emptying but with practice it’s actually pretty quick and easily manageable. Totally satisfied! 🤗"
5,"Best control features! I was looking for good quality wireless headphones but didn’t want to spend a ton of money and came across these headphones. I had previously purchased wireless headphones of a different kind and was very disappointed with what I got, so I was apprehensive about these ones when I bought them. However, when I received these I was very pleased with the quality and features of the headphones. These headphones fit perfectly in my ear and are comfortable to wear for a longer period of time. The case, that doubles as a charging station is also awesome. The case tells you how much it is charged and your headphones automatically begin charging when you put them in the case. The best feature about these headphones is the control. You can easily adjust the volume, go to the next song or go back very easily. The user manual is very clear and straightforward on how to work the headphones. I highly recommend this product to anyone looking for good quality headphones at a reasonable price!"
5,"Great value for price, love the extras I love this product! Competitive qualities with other top name brands, but a better price, and great reviews on Amazon!  Updated: Still loving this product, but after doing some reading and making messes with raw eggs, I'll NOT be using the blending cup that comes with this. I'm about to toss it in the recycle or something. I put like 4 eggs in there with the whisk attachment, and no joke, all over the kitchen. I don't know why they didn't design it to have a lip, like a mason jar (which is what I blend in, mostly).  I use the whisk a lot for eggs, and also to whip up my homemade IP coconut yogurt (it's made with gelatin, so....needs whisking to be yogurt-textured).  I thought the craze over these things was ridiculous, but I love it. The food chopper/processor works really well, and it's got a good capacity.  Plus points for easy handling. Can operate with one hand, while holding your bowl/jar with the other. Also, it has a LONG CORD. Woo!"
5,"Comfortable for their size! Bought these from Amazon ""renewed"". Looked brand new upon opening the box. I switched out the ear tips for some Sony hybrid tips which made a big difference in getting a good deal. More comfortable than I expected as I was able to wear them for about 4 hours with no discomfort. I did have to reseat them a few times, but they never fell out. That could be because I was sweating making them a little more slippery though. Haven't tried the cush fins yet. Sound is about that of other budget priced Bluetooth earbuds, bass is decent for an 8mm driver, definitely not basshead level but enough to give energy and emotion to music. Typical V signature, mids are there, but definitely not up front. Highs are present but maybe just a little subdued, not ear piercing even at high volumes. Would be nice to have AptX but hard to fault a $40 pair of truly wireless buds. Listening to multiple genres and and if you're just wanting to get your toes wet and try out true wireless without spend $100+, these are definitely worth it!"
5,"True Skullcandy Headphones Solid black in color in a small convenient container for charging and storing.  Magnetized so the ear pieces stay put.  These were almost too easy to set up.  Opened the box and took them out of the box, the blue light was blinking, looked at my phone and they were pairing.  Easy USB charging.  Pressing the skull on either side has different controls.  One side play the other pause.  One side answer the call and the other side to end the call."
5,"Perfect for everyday use The sling bag is perfect for every day use. I keep phone chargers, writing notebook, knife, pen etc.. which works with day use."
5,"Love it!!! Lots of space It's been a while since I bought a backpack. I this backpack has a very good size. Lots of space, from electronic to other things that you might pack for your travel. Material seems very sturdy and durable. Very happy with my purchase. Very fair price."
2,"Way to Sturdy; looks like a suitcase The bag has nice features however, the bag was way too structured and heavy. If you're a high school or college student, would not recommend."
3,"i need to use a pen to push the buttons in. nice watch, but the top left button is so flat i need to use a pen or something to push it in. the buttons are sort of hard to access, but yet they dont dig into your wrist so its a toss up. holding up fine so far, waterproof. comfortable. as most chinese crap its a bit confusing getting to the count down timer and stopwatch, but all around i expext to get a few years out of it. i dont see anything on this watch that sets it apart from any other. Nothing makes this watch industrial rated or bulletproof. its a w-mart quality watch. if anything, the thing is thicker plastic on the face witch will help with scratching. but so far so good. cheers."
1,"PIECE OF ""BLEEP"" i had this anklet for 2 months &amp; it already snapped! i would have been better off buying a $10 anklet, probably would have latest longer &amp; i'm not eligible to get a replacement. i am not happy"
1,"Said 2 bottles but only received 1. Also only one use per bottle  Misleading directions Ordered 2 pack.... just opened to find only one bottle.  BTW only one use per bottle according to instructions  Beware !!!"
1,"Buyer beware Would give zero stars if I could.&nbsp; Chain turned black in 2 days and started giving me a rash around my neck. Should have known better when they sent cleaning instructions before I even got the product. I wear silver all the time and never have gotten a reaction like this. Cheap product that I have serious doubts is real sterling silver&nbsp;"
4,"conveiniant good"
4,"As for the GA100 I love the look and style I have been wearing G-Shocks since 1987 and have always been a big fan of them.  As for the GA100 I love the look and style.  The flat black stealth look is awesome.  This is my first G-Shock with hands and I truly like it.  Here comes my only issue.  All of my previous G-Shocks have had excellent backlighting.  This model however does not.  This is my one and only complaint with the watch.  I hope Casio improves this in the future.  But still a really awesome looking and tough as nails watch."
5,"Five Stars This is a great  little suitcase!!! It is durable and works well for my granddaughter."
5,"Great and lightly scented This menstrual cup wash is great. It has a wonderful formula and a very light citrus scent. It didn't irritate my vagina at all which I feared it might have."
5,"Stacking I love organizing and these are perfect for my drawers. The best feature is that they stack on one another. I bought 2 sets."
5,"So easy to change and reasonably priced! Love the fast ship and these are quality filters! I know having this quantity on hand will be beneficial to my changing the filter as recommended by the manufacturer, something I have forgotten time to time 😬"
5,"Awesome! Great quality!"
5,"If you're looking for classy this is it. Super classy,it's the most classy watch I have that's under $100. Beautiful look and touch overall very happy."
5,"Awesome Workout Shorts! These are some amazing workout shorts! The colors are vibrant and they fit like true compression shorts. I am 5'3"" and 110 lbs and I ordered a pair in the x-small size and they fit just right. They will be a bit snug since they are compression shorts but they definitely stay in place and won't ride up even in heavy workouts.  I would definitely be buying another in a different color! I most likely will be getting the small next time though to compare and in case I wanted a pair to not be as snug. Overall, a very cute and sturdy pair of compression workout shorts! Especially for the price!"
5,"Great for the price Love it! My husband and I will be spending a few weeks in Europe for our belated honeymoon, and this backpack is the perfect size to be considered our carry-on and for day trips- I bought all black, he chose the blue/yellow version. A lot of pockets, waterproof material, smooth zippers, and it folds flat. It has a separate laptop compartment, pen holders, and it opens completely so you don't need to dig in your bag. The straps are comfortable on your shoulders, and the lightweight material almost makes it feel like you don't have a backpack on at all. The hardware seems to be able to withstand use, it doesn't feel like it's going to just fall apart on you.  I'll update once we get back from Europe to let you know how it withstood some hard wear n tear!"
5,"All Darn Tough, All the Time I pretty much have decided I'm going all Darn Tough for my socks. They're just that good. Comfy and soft, fit well, and truly are tough. I didn't really want to get the full on, super long boot socks, so luckily these were long enough to go with my 6"" LL Bean Boots."
5,"No More Mistakes I use these with the Rocketbook Everlast.  Like all the different color choices for my writing and drawing.  Also, like to use these when I write in books so that I can erase if desired. Pros: They work with Rocketbooks They erase with friction (or with soft damp cloth on Everlast) The ink disappears in heat/ reappears if you stick in freezer.  Yippee so fun! Cons: The ink disappears in heat/ reappears if you stick in freezer.  Boo! What a pain. Ink smears if you smudge before drying Line density not always uniform. Like some gel pens.  I will buy them again or get the ink refills when mine run out"
5,"Five Stars This is an awesome kitchen device.....appears to be well made and works well!"
5,"Five Stars Beautiful. I love it."
5,"Good for the price This thin definitely does the job. Sharp and has a safety feature which I love, however you can definitely tell it is plastic when pressing down on the blade. You need to hold the paper because the weight distribution is off and I believe it is the fact that its plastic and it pulls the paper. Maybe I am dumb. Either way, it is pretty cheaply made. You have to hold your paper in place to get a good cut!"
2,"Returned I ended up returning the necklace.  It just wasn't what I was expecting and seemed cheap and flimsy."
3,"Be sure you read all the info before you buy.. I am sure the product is fine.  It is just not Right for me.  I am returning it and odering The right product for me .."
3,"It irritates my hyper-sensitive skin. I love this stuff. It smells good, and keeps me fresh. However, I keep breaking out when I use it. When I stop using it, my skin clears up. I wish that didn’t happen, but I have autoimmune issues and my skin is way more sensitive than most people’s."
1,"Thinking of returning this. A strong plastic smell.  We're still searching for a kettle that doesn't have plastic in contact with the water or the steam.  Want glass with stainless steel."
4,"Awesome This was a really cool product and my mom loves it. Its just not the best quality and not the best it could be which is why i didnt give it 5 stars."
4,"Four Stars Personally don't love the material on the inside. It's more of a fuzzy material. Otherwise a cute jacket!"
4,"UNBELIEVABLY NOISY, but it does the job I just picked this up at the store the other day, and thought I'd write a review because it has some big pros and cons.  As for the pros, this thing does actually work...really well.  I used to have a Kitchenaid blender for about triple what I paid for this Oster, and it left chunks in my fruit smoothies no matter how much I blended.  It also leaked a bit.  The Oster blends frozen fruit and berries to a smooth consistency without ANY chunks whatsoever.  I was kinda amazed because I figured if my expensive blender left chunks, then that was the norm for all blenders.  So I'm very happy that it does the job very well.  However, it does have a couple downfalls.  There is only one speed, a pulse, and the off setting.  This doesn't bother me too much though, because as long as it blends my smoothies smooth, then I'm happy no matter what the speed is.  This blender's big downfall is its noise:  this thing is louder than hell.  It's about as loud as a gas powered leaf blower.  It actually hurts my ears, and I'm seriously considering wearing earplugs to make morning smoothies.  The loudness isn't the whole issue either.  It has this high-pitched whine that just really irritates my ears.  I guess that's why they called it the Beehive Blender...  In conclusion, it's a good blender because it actually does what it's supposed to do.  However, BE WARNED:  it is VERY LOUD!!!  It will wake your entire house up!  UPDATE:  04/24/2013...2.5 years later!  I still love this blender.  I know I probably sound like I work for this company, but seriously, I haven't had a single problem with it yet.  Five days a week, I make a morning smoothie with frozen berries and fruits.  So it gets quite a bit of use.  It still blends everything down to a smooth consistency, however, I noticed it takes a tiny bit longer...probably because the blades are dulled a bit (which I'm sure I can just sharpen them back up).  Plus, it has never leaked even once.  So overall, I HIGHLY recommend it.  Who would think that a $60 blender would last 2.5 years?  I guess when things work as they should you kinda take them for granted."
5,"Beautiful and Well Made I love this bracelet.  It’s one of my most worn pieces.  I pair it with another wrap from this maker.  It has gotten wet and never tarnished.  I love the silver and gold together!"
5,"Five Stars Best deal for a blender out there.. This is the deal you're looking for. Just get it."
5,"Five Stars Very pretty excellent condition my husband fell in love with this watch."
5,"Just get it! Absolutely perfect for harley quinn costume, the cold letters were so sturdy and much much much better quality then expected. The letters are interchangeable too."
5,"BIG Works great"
5,"Good value. True to size, I’m in between a medium and large in most products wearing about a size 10 in most things. This large has a little extra room in it for my size but not too large.  Well made for the money and I would purchase again. I bought the charcoal grey. It’s like nice spandex swimsuit material, hangs nicely, well made. Not too thin."
5,"Good quality for the price and perfect size This is a really good price for what you get. 3 pairs of different color hoops and a small pair of silver ones, too. They are good quality and very light and comfortable to wear. The colors are nice, too. They are the exact size that I like. Very happy with this purchase."
5,"Won't do hormones so.... Great internal moistuizer for post menopause. Best I've tried...doesn't make you too uncomforably moist. If you are like me and shy away from hormones....these do help!"
5,"BEST PORTABLE BLENDER !!! I bought this one for my mom, she loves it. It is so convenience that she can use anywhere, on the car, at work, at home. It is powerful, can crush ice, icy fruit. I also use it for whey protein shake, baby milk. Highly recommended."
5,"Love it Very nice quality and I love that the laptop compartment is sort of inside, it's like right against your back, easily accessible but hard to get to if someone wanted to steal it  And it has a ton of pockets and stuff. Really nice one"
5,"Comfortable shiny shorts! This product looks exactly like the photo, more of a gym shorts cut than a yoga shorts cut. Super adorable with my elf costume! They are shiny so very little ""breathing"" to the fabric but that was expected."
5,"They are a great tennis shoe!! Love them!! Fit great!!"
5,"""Garden Martini"" made to perfection I make a concoction that I refer to as a ""Garden Martini"" and prior to getting my HB Smoothie Blender I mulled the ingredients which wasn't too bothersome; however, last night I decided to place all of the recipe in the blender with several large ice cubes and pressed the smoothie button and the results were truely amazing. The best smoothie ever!"
2,"Not as capable as the original - must have been redesigned for non-stick Not the same as the originals which would clean (and scratch) like steel wool, and get off the toughest stuff. These have been changed so as not to seriously damage non-stick coatings - But I can get something like that anywhere."
3,"Okay Nice materials, but the thickness doesn't taper off much at the edges, so that may cause some irritation to your skin, especially if the positioning is a little off. The cover is reasonably soft and better than some of the petroleum-heavy options."
1,"You have to check out where it was made from. After they changed the manufacture, quality went bad. You have to check out where it was made from."
1,"thin I have worn smart wool for many years, I am greatly disappointed that they are so thin now compared to what they were and the price keeps going up, less for more. I will not buy them again."
1,"If you are looking for a tissue paper bra... this one is for you I was so optimistic. Reviews were pretty great... As soon as I saw it in its package I knew it wasn't going to work. It was  like tissue paper. If you have large breasts, this flimsy piece is not for you. It is so thin nothing is covered. For those of you who have breastfed or have large nipples, don't even get me started. Talk about seeing everything. Felt like I was naked, which if you are going for that kind of thing this would be great. I will say that I did like the underwires and the straps. But I was really disappointed with the lack of thickness. I was really hoping this would be the one. Way overpriced. For the price I was expecting a resemblance of quality but this didn't even hit close to the mark. Extremely disappointed."
4,"A bit snug, but that's not a bad thing I'm 5'10, a curvy size 12 with DDD cup size. I purchased the leotard in a size L because they didn't have an XL. I don't regret my decision to purchase the L despite it being a bit snug. The material is a nice heavy cotton and the leotard looks as expected and described. It has some stretch, but not like typical stretch items, which I see as a plus. The shelf bra keeps everything in place, and gives decent support which I wasn't expecting. If you wear a large cup size as well and are buying this for dancing, I would recommend an additional sports bra or something similar for extra support, these leotards are made for small breasts. The thickness of the fabric also makes it opaque, so you can't see through it at all."
4,"Great size Just got today. Really appreciate the alcohol swab for ease of prepping them. Great size for my 5 year-old twins who lose one earring always now I have a back-up that won’t break the bank."
5,"nice Sturdy and great value for the cost. These will last me forever!"
5,"Good value Best price"
5,"Practice before you get your period Okay so I really fell in love with the design so I got it. I’d just gotten off my period and couldn’t wait to try it. Low and behold my period arrived again after stopping for two days. And boy did it have a vengeance as I was at a birthday party about to get in the pool. I remembered I had my disc in my purse and decided to use it because I had nothing else on me. I followed the directions and tried to shove it on up there. It was notttt easy in any way shape or form. I’ve got kids banging on the bathroom door having too pee and I can’t seem to get the disc in or out properly. I’ve got blood all over the floor and I’m panicking with every knock of the demons trying to come in.  I stood up, bent over, squatted like I was in the woods, put my leg up on the counter and I could not get the damn thing in properly. I scoured the bathroom cabinets hoping I could find tampons or pads. (Wasn’t my house) the gods shined upon me and I found a pack of pads. After cleaning all the blood off my legs and floor I washed the disc off put it back in its little pouch and did my walk of shame... DO NOT WAIT UNTIl YOU START TO USE IT!!! Practice before hand!!! I’m 27 and I’ve had 5 kids. I figured I’d have no problem shoving that thing in. Boy was I wrong."
5,"Push pins These work great and hold up well."
5,"Beautiful for every day wear Bought these for my wedding and they have turned into everyday earrings. Look beautiful, shine bright, vey lightwrigh.perfect with any dress. Great jewel pattern and plenty of sparkle. I wore it for 7 hours and it never irritated my skin (which is very sensitive)"
5,"Great for the price. Just beautiful. I have 3 holes in each ear &amp; the graduation in size is Perfect. I love that they come with silver &amp; rubber backs. I prefer the rubber backs because they do not come off when doing my hair. They came is a nice velvet bag &amp; at first I thought there was only one pair but not true had to look further, Great for the price."
5,"Loved it even more in person I liked it more in person than I was expecting too. Great quality."
5,"Nice item Nice item"
5,"Can't go wrong with a Vitamix. I have had ... Can't go wrong with a Vitamix.  I have had one for years and years.  I upgraded and gave my old one to a relative."
5,"Must have Super obsessed with these. Highly recommend them"
5,"Works great These socks are great. Yes they are thin but not too thin. They are holding up well. They are my favorite socks and probably will order more. Go great with leggings because they are just barely visible."
5,"Five Stars Great tap shoes!"
5,"Love them ! Perfect bottles ! On a whim I ordered a set of three that came with a blue, green, and purple bottle because my son was needing bigger bottles as he was still taking newborn sized of a different brand. These are the best, so so so easy to clean and the colors they have spark joy. He took to them happily and the flow they come with are perfect for him. Happy mama here."
2,"I LOVE coffee, but not dark roast My husband bought this because of all the hype around it on a health podcast he listens to, but I didn't feel any difference between this coffee and my regular cup.  I didn't care for the flavor of this coffee. Even with cream it tasted bitter and burnt to me. Also, it gave me a bit of a stomach ache the 2nd day I drank it. I think, because I drank it without food.? Besides cream, I have MCT oil in my coffee, so maybe the combination of this coffee and that was the key? I am bummed that I cannot return it.  Maybe I should try it black after eating something? One thing I know for sure is I shouldn't let my husband do the shopping on Amazon."
3,"Hoops are small the hoops themselves are kind of small but the other rings are very cute"
3,"They work, but come with compromise Overall a solid product but I encounter frequent issues with the 2 sides staying connected, and with the looseness of the fit.  I have a lot more problems with them staying connected then I can recall ever having with previous true wireless soundpeat phones for a 1/4 the cost.  The rubber adapters are a proprietary design and only come in 3 sizes, with a notable jump in size from small to medium. This means I can either hurt my ears with medium or except a looser and noiser fit with small. Would appreciate it if they fix this."
1,"During the holidays we used both sides of the coffee maker and it worked beautifully. After my family left I started using only ... I bought this coffee maker just before Thanksgiving, 2017. During the holidays we used both sides of the coffee maker and it worked beautifully. After my family left I started using only the K cup side. In a few weeks I started experiencing exploding cups intermittently. Then the single cup side stopped working altogether. It seemed like the water was heating up but it wouldn't run through the cup. I wish I had read the reviews with 1 star before purchasing this coffee maker. DO NOT BUY IT! We have a Keurig coffee maker at work that gets used regularly and has worked for over 2 years with no problems. Wish I had spent a little more money for it rather than purchasing this machine."
4,"Birthday decade jewelry My sister loved it for her 60th bday!  I liked the overall necklace but maybe it was just me but I kinda was confused why there was a bag and what would happen to the necklace if you didn't use the bag?  Tarnish?"
4,"So comfortable I honestly wasn't expecting much from these socks because I've only ever had one type of socks that I felt more than just meh about. But these are FANTASTIC. They first perfectly, they are great quality, so freaking comfortable. My only complaint is that a few of the socks came with runs in them. But overall these are amazing!"
4,"Good Deal. Some Design Flaws. Looks nice. Works great. Good price. Only thing I don't like is the door latch is on the bottom right which means the door swings open towards your left hand, which has a plate in it so it's kind of awkward.  The buttons are practically invisible unless you have a good light right on it, but you are standing in front of it so fat chance. I keep a small flashlight on top of the microwave so I can see the buttons. But for $89 can't really complain."
5,"Bought by accident but it's awesome! I meant to buy cheaper paper and didn't realize what I was buying. It's awesome and looks really cool. I won't likely buy it again because I need cheap, but it's been fun having it"
5,"PENS Great Price for 60 Pens, great for office workers and just to use at home $5.00 and delivered for free, can't beat that with a stick.  And when you need one you have one!"
5,"Excellent Excellent...I have several of these bracelets and have given several as gifts."
5,"Great product These are great. I was worried because when they came they appeared somewhat cheap and flimsy; I can see why people keep asking if this is actually a Medela product or a knockoff brand. It’s the real thing; they are solid and well made. I would get them again."
5,"Five Stars Very nice! Fit my child's ear perfectly and have stayed on securely during everyday use! Very happy!"
5,"Fleece with Pocket Great leggings....warm and has a pocket.  Why is it so hard to find leggings with a pocket and extra warm.  This company did a great job.  Good quality for the price."
5,"Fancy watch! Bought it for my husband. He loved it. It’s comfortable on the wrist. Looks very fancy!"
5,"High Quality I absolutely love these panty-liners. Before, I would use Kotex pantyliners and were constantly changing them every time I had to go to the bathroom. Other pantyliners don't absorb smell so it gets pretty gross but the Rael one is unscented and really prevents odors and really really absorbs better so I use like 5x less of the Rael pads than the Kotex ones I used to use. It also has a flexible hold and feels like I don't have anything on. So, in some of the reviews, I saw that people were saying that it scrunched up and when I first used this product, I had that same thing happen to me. But I realized quickly that as long as I make sure the middle part points upwards (tent shaped) when I put on my underwear, it prevents this from happening. The flexibility and softness of the pad makes it so that it can scrunch, but if that happens, it's because I was not wearing it properly. I've used 2 packages of these pads so far and they haven't done that since the first time I tried them on. Mostly, they are so gentle, and soft and absorbs smells. I guess sometimes quality really makes a difference. Will never go back to any other pantyliner. This definitely is my favorite and I won't be using anything else."
5,"You will be happy! Great vacation dress. It’s hard to say if it runs a big or not. It depends on what the look is you are going for. What I can say it is comfy and even if it’s “big” it will still look amazing! I was complemented ALL DAY"
5,"Great cheap watch Fantastic watch, had it for about 8 months and I wear it to work every week day. It is very light but suprisingly sturdy, I work in a metal shop as a welder and it has held up way better than I expected. Other reviews lamented the plastic face instead of quartz, but I think the plastic helps keep the price low, which is what I wanted it for. The back light for checking the time at night is pretty decent too.  Only possible downsides are it is quite loud, I can hear it from across my bedroom when trying to sleep, but I prefer some white noise so I'm alright with it. Also the nylon band gets stinky after awhile, but they always do, and it is easily remedied with some light dish soap and water."
5,"Warm but not bulky and look great! I Use as a winter sock inside and out-live in the U.P. Of Michigan. Not too bulky for inside my below 20 degree boots &amp; not too thin for inside on cold floors. Comfy, soft, blend of colors nice, not scratchy either. Been looking for wool blend sock in black color &amp; that protects my frostbite damaged feet. Great!"
5,"These punch harder and higher than their price point suggests I just ran through the first full charge on these earbuds. They sound better than the price point may lead one to believe. Bass is quite full compared to other wireless buds I've used with mids not very accurate and fairly decent highs. At this price point ($30-35) you really cannot have very high expectations. The multifunction buttons built into both earbuds do not feel very intuitive and take some force to actuate. I did not enjoy pausing, resuming or changing volume as every push resulted in pushing them deeper into my ear canal, which is not that much fun.  The case is not particularly large and would fit in any pocket. The magnets inside the case will definitely keep the buds secure to their charging locations. There is no external case indication of charge status of the ear buds. You have to open the case and look at the LEDs on the buds themselves in order to find out whether they are done charging, or not. The two external LEDs on the case are solely to indicate case charging status. If you look very closely and focus on the lid of the case you will find out that it's partially transparent and the ear bud LEDs may be visible through the case lid, but not in all conditions. If you are outside in bright light you're unlikely to be able to see through the case lid, but inside and in dim lighting they should be visible without opening the lid. Case lid can be operated single handed if needed.  I made a 1 hour long phone call with no mic quality complaints. I also spent another 3.5 hours playing music at volume between 35 and 50% for a total charge lasting 4.5 hours.  There are a total of 4 sizes tips included in the box to cater to different sized ear canals. I highly suggest experimenting with the different sized tips to get the best fit before you start judging noise cancellation, volume or how securely they fit into your ears.  Additionally when placing these buds into your ears, you should use a twisty motion for best fitment and also grasp the bud on its sides and avoid pushing the multi-function button.  Only 1 microphone hole is visible on each bud, but both buds have a separate microphone allowing them to each be paired and used separately for phone calls or if you want to listen to music/podcasts/video with one bud only in mono mode. That requires a separate pairing setup compared to stereo pairing with a device.  I will make it a point to use this set only going forward over the next few weeks in order to fully evaluate them and update the review with more insight and real world usage statistics, but so far so good. Definitely a good buy in this price range and they seem to deliver a lot of value at a very reasonable price point that is affordable to the masses.  6 Month Update: As I approach the 6 month mark I decided to take a second look at these earbuds. They have been my daily drivers for the past 5+ months. They have been great for phone calls and listening to music. The battery life has stayed consistent throughout and I have yet to keep them in my ear long enough to completely drain the case to a point where earbuds and case are both dead. I am quite keen of the way they sound and I highly recommend purchasing these. They do not do very well when running, but for walking, commuting, desk, couch, cleaning around the house and other more mellow activities these earbuds certainly hold their own and remain an excellent value in the segment."
5,"Cute. Functional. Not a Powerhouse. Okay, so read all the reviews. It's worth it to weigh it out; I hardly used the microwave I had, so when I moved and needed a new one, I chanced this cute one. I'll update my review in a few months when I've really utilized it more and *if* I experience any problems. It has a small footprint for my small kitchen, it's cute, and it doesn't suck energy with a clock I don't need. I made popcorn no problem and reheated a calzone - YUM. It accommodated my large soup plate with no problem.  The ""Power On"" button has to be pressed firmly to turn it on, but it feels very secure and not loose or ""jiggly"" at all. All the other controls are intuitive, but the manual that comes with it explains really clearly. It comes with a 1yr Manufacturer Warranty, should I have any problems this year. I'm happy so far!"
2,"Not great Even as a completely inexperienced painter I can tell these are not very nice. The brush hairs are firm and they don't quite behave the way it seems like they should when pressed to a surface. I'd rather have one really nice brush for this price. Lesson learned, you get what you pay for."
3,"Excellent coffee in PLASTIC non-biodegradable containers I rated a 3 because of the plastic containers.  Get with the program Newman and make bio-degradable containers.  The coffee deserves this attention as most people will not recycle a K-cup container.  Coffee is delicious and not bitter.  I'll wait for the earth friendly container before buying again."
1,"You get what you pay for,  so don't The first one that I woke broke before the end of the day.  Nuff said"
1,"Nearly the worst coffee I have ever tried. I found this coffee to lack any richness or depth of flavor. It also has a strong bitter after taste. Everyone has different tastes but I cannot believe that this product is currently getting 4.5 stars. Thankfully Amazon offers a money back satisfaction guarantee, which I took advantage of. So, you have nothing to lose when you try Amazon coffee. Go for it. If you hate it like I did, initiate a return. They will refund your purchase price."

4,"Love it - 5 plus years of use before needing a new one NOTE: This review is for a previous model than the one currently selling - This review is for the one that did NOT have a safety switch on the top.  This review is a positive one, and pretty much just a heads-up of a potential issue with daily use.  I LOVE this blender. It had a Limited 3-year warranty, and mine lasted over 5 years of daily use. The blade sheered in half today from what I can only imagine must have been metal fatigue. It still blends my drinks, but it is wobbly and sounds loud now.  So this is just a heads up that this can happen. I called Cuisinart to let them know about the issue. They recommended purchasing a new shaft/blade, but with shipping is just a few dollars short of a new blender...  So good-bye to one, hello to another!  Overall, I'm not sure any other blender would have lasted this long."
4,"Good deal, cute earring set. Inexpensive and cute. It was packaged in a cute little black drawstring bag and each pair wrapped separately. They are stainless steel and  Not a polished silver but still cute.  The smallest I have to my 8 year old daughter, and i am currently wearing the 2nd smallest..  In all a good deal."
4,"Exactly what I hoped it would be I gave this watch four stars because it is exactly what I hoped it would be, which is an inexpensive everyday watch that I don't have to worry about beating up, but didn't really wow me.  While the 25 dollars I spent was on the higher end of my target range, I have been pleased that there were no disappointments after opening the box.  The quality of the materials feel noticeably cheaper than my more expensive MVMT watch, but for the price I think the look and feel is surprisingly good.  I have been mostly pleased with the light weight and thin/not to large diameter dimensions.  I wear it both under and over my lab coat (which has tight elastic cuffs) and under nitrile gloves at work and it doesn't feel too bulky or restrictive of movement.  The parts that connect to the band don't really conform to the curve of my smallish wrists, but the overall slimness mostly makes that a non-issue for me.  Probably my biggest complaint is setting the watch.  It works well enough, but the nob feels a little fragile when pulled out and it's frustrating that the minute hand moves a little when you push it back in, changing the time from what you set it to to something slightly off.  I'm not too particular about accuracy, but I did try to anticipate the movement and got pretty close to where I was aiming for.  (The rest is just a reflection on the pros and cons of a steel mesh band.  The band I received on my watch works fine and is as advertised.) The steel mesh band took me a minute to figure out, as I've never had one before and there weren't really clear instructions on how to latch it.  Once I figured it out, though, I found the ease of removal appealing.  As a person who is typically on the hot and sweaty side I like that the band is cooler than leather and more comfortable than steel links.  The trade off is that I had to get used to keeping the band at the same length all day (since it's not easy to adjust on the go) whereas I would sometimes loosen the band to move it around on my wrist and let some of the sweat evaporate with a leather strap.  Overall I""m quite happy with my choice comfort wise and I think that the style fits very nicely in the casual but not too casual range I was going for."
5,"great! MAM has some great bottles and nipples!  These work great and we don't have as much gas.  Also they do not leak like the dr brown bottles."
5,"comfy phone-carrying pocket running capri As an avid runner, I am always looking for a comfortable breathable lightweight capri.  I always carry my phone so I can listen to my downloaded running playlist. The bilateral side pockets carry my iPhone 7 well without pulling down for my longer distant runs due to the higher reinforced waist.  I am 5"", and 115lbs and these fit perfectly.  The material provides good coverage where the underwear and lines don't show through.  The  compression is not bad, not too tight, and definitely not loose.  The material is also comfortable soft and wicks moisture away nicely.  The cut and material pattern is very flattering, and I appreciate the reinforced stitching.  Since I live in the desert, the winters are mild in the evening  so these provide some coverage and warmth needed when the evening temp is in the lower to mid-60s/ upper 50s outside.  I don't feel these would provide the thicker warmth required in the colder weather but it works for where I live.  I am definitely getting more pairs in different colors."
5,"Beautiful! The charm looks like its made with very nice quality. It came in a cute little box."
5,"Fits fabulous bwith clothing Found these items to be perfect."
5,"Perfecto Perfecto para la aspiradora. Se ajusta y limpia Sin ningún problema. Los filtros hepa no encantan al 100 pero no afecta al funcionamiento."
5,"Wear it as a rope/short jacket. Comfy wrap. Lovely comfy, cozy robe/jacket. Whether you wear it indoors as a robe or outside as a jacket this is nice and cozy. I chose it to wear as an indoor robe around the house when it gets chilly in case someone comes to the door and I have to answer. I’m not indisposed. It’s nice to snuggle up with. But there have been a couple of occasions when I’ve needed to run to the store and I have this “robe” on and it looks lovely as a jacket.  So, whether you choose to wear this indoors or outdoors, in private or in public, this is a nice soft, cozy wrap. Note: this does not have any mechanism of closure. No belt, buttons or zippers. I missed that when ordering. But don’t find it problematic. Nice deep pockets. Very slouchy look.  Material is very soft.  Lightweight, but bulky.  Casual and comfortable.  The wrists are elastic cuffs and fit tight around the wrist, however the rest of the piece is very loose fitting."
5,"The PERFECT EARRINGS! Listen ladies, we all know the pain of earrings catching on our clothes and ruining them (its always your favorite shirt, too!), snagging in our hair, or getting poked in the neck with a piece of the earring when we answer the phone! It sucks! So when you find good earrings that do none of the above, they quickly become favorites. If you're like me, you try to find more in that same style! I've recently really fallen in love with this printed leather style because they hold up well, they're really lightweight, you can get something to match LITERALLY EVERYTHING, you can usually get multiple pairs at once for a really great price! I'm going to give some of them as gifts, but also keep several pair for myself because duh - they are too cute to give them all away! I REALLY LOVE the plaid, glittery Christmas trees, and Rudolph - totally keeping these ones! Love that I can have some lightweight, affordable, festive Christmas earrings for me and others!"
5,"Awesome Great product and looks more expensive than advertised. I get compliments everyday. I've had no issues with this sling bag."
5,"I’m a fan! I’m in love with this body wash because of the quality and pleasant scent."
5,"Expect a large increase in appearance of breasts I can’t say that there anything wrong with this product so I’m giving it 5 stars  even though I’m returning them.  I am looking for a slight push up to make my breasts more even however these are quite large and absolutely make me a whole cup (if not more) larger."
5,"Love! First time buying jewelry on amazon. Love these earring. Great value for the price. I came across the exact ones but were more $$. Glad I went with these cheaper pair bc they’re perfect and I’ll definitrly buy other colors. They look exactly like they do on the picture."
5,"Back pack Light weight"
5,"Love it, I have used it almost daily since I got it and it works a charm! I have been loving this!  I have used it almost daily since getting it, works great for my almost daily smoothie and everything else I've used it for so far.  The noise complaint of other reviewers, I don't get.  It's barely louder if at all louder than every other blender I've ever used.  The blades are sharp and can be scary to clean, yes.  If you let the stuff sit on there and dry on there.  Just rinse right after you use and you won't have this issue.  Better to have sharp blades that work than dull blades that are ""easy to clean"" and don't do the job.  I love this blender and the capability of large batches of things or single batches.  I definitely use the single serve the most and it is great!  Love just taking it off the blender base and sticking the lid on and drinking straight out of it.  So much nicer and cleaner than transferring to another drinking container.  Some functions won't work with the single serve containers, like the ""smoothie"" button, which is a little misleading considering the most typical use for the small containers are probably ""smoothies"", but I'm not knocking a star off because it doesn't affect how well it actually works.  I just use the medium button and it blends my smoothie very smoothly.  I use a combo of frozen fruit and fresh fruit for my smoothies, no ice.  So if you're wanting a smoothie with ice, I would bet the large container will work better for that that gives you the ""smoothie"" option.  But really, this blender is great and I would recommend it to anyone!"
5,"Little, but works great! He works so hard for such a little guy. I use my Krups grinder for grinding spices and coffee (I go through with a chopstick to loosen up the stragglers hanging on to the edge of the walls and also grind a piece of bread that cleans up the smells and excess grindings handing about.)  That being said I find it great for people like me who just do single cups of coffee in a Kurig. It does blend a bit on the fine side, so sometimes you need to like the custom cups with a little paper to prevent sludge from happening.  It's a great blender for the price and it's size, definitely!"
2,"Problem with door. There seems to be a problem with the door communicating with function buttons. I read the reviews before I purchased but gave the company the benefit of the doubt thinking problem would have been corrected. The issue is still a problem. Sad part is I really love the microwave."
3,"Does everything you need, but check the band size Great watch and has everything you would need for it to be successful except the band is smaller than expected. I hoped it would have been at least an 8 inch band, but this one was less than 7.5 inches. It's being returned to get a model that doesn't need to buy a new watch band to fit."
3,"This review is not for the machine itself This review is not for the machine as the machine is great.  I just wanted to highlight that this particular set only comes with one blade. It does not come with a flat blade which is necessary for grinding or a cross blade.  Please beware while purchasing this set.  Still it is a good value for the money."
1,"Company does not honor the warranty... These headphones worked for a couple of months and then died.  They will no longer take a charge or operate.  Although the company did answer my email and ask for my address on November 26th, they have not honored their warranty; and they have not answered 3 follow up emails. Basically money thrown down the drain.  I am going to try and call Amazon corporate to complain and ask for a refund."
1,"Worst Sport I've ever owned/wore I have another Champion brand sports bra and love it.  This one is just horrible. I'd give it 0 stars, but that is not an option. I can usually walk into any store and pick any brand of bra in a 36D and it will fit perfectly.  Can't even this one around my chest. There is absolutely no support in the cups either.  I prefer molded cups and these are just flat stretchy pieces of fabric. There is no ""petal"" in the cups to hide if you are driving with your headlights on.  Not the look I was going for."
4,"Very cute! BUT, has a small hole in it... I really love this top and plan on ordering it in other colors. It is made of great material and is a good fit, with just the right amount of detail and cuteness. I like wearing these tops you tie in the back for yoga, tennis and running, so I don't feel like my top is all over the place. Aside from the small tear, which I noticed after I took off the tag, it's great! Long gone are the days of me spending $60 on a top from lululemon or Athleta."
4,"Not cotton shirts Not cotton shirts. Stretchyish material. I would size up if you want a loose fit"
5,"Great Purchase Fast shipping and the order was just as described. I absolutely love the backpack and can’t wait to start using it. Thank you so much!"

5,"perfect. Absolutely comfortable right out of the box Can you imagine buying a pair of shoes online and having them fit perfectly, without even trying them on. Followed direction on sizing. I wear size 8 in a dress shoe, went up 1/2 size in this athletic shoe, perfect. Absolutely comfortable right out of the box. I am not a runner but wear them all day, I am a 'mature' woman and feel very stable wearing this shoe. Also, nice looking, (the shoe, not me)."

5,"Diseño y calidad Exelente para el regalo de los 16 de mi hija, le encantó"
5,"They were great until I lost them This was a wonderful product for the short time I wore it. Wore it white water rafting. Kept me dry and was light weight and kept me a perfect temperature on the water. Unfortunately, I fell in to a Class 3 rapid. In my washing machine twisting and turning down the rapids, I lost these pants. I had some swim bottoms on, but they were half pulled off by the time I made it to another raft waiting in an eddy for me.... so everyone got to see at least half of my butt as I was pulled into the raft. Really wish that I still had my waterproof pants on.  If anyone finds them on the Arkansas River between Buena Vista, Colorado and the State of Arkansas, I would love them back. Not sure if I’m ever going rafting again."
5,"solar powered I had been wanting a solar powered watch and when I saw a decent priced Seiko watch that was nice looking I jumped on it....My first leather band but I am happy with it and the look....believe there are automatic date watches but wasn't ready to pay the price yet....Haven't had long but enjoying wearing it.."
5,"Good blender for the price I find this blender to be very good for most uses. However, it's a bit cantankerous to use. The jar must be positioned in just the right spot for it to work. It's not meant for hard core use because it clogs sometimes. You have to scrape the sides often. But, easy to assemble and clean."
5,"As good as they look in the picture Beautifully made and stylish, Good purchase with this price, I was really surprise at the great quality of these pieces. I did have to fix these earrings that did not lay right but that was easy. I will introduce it to my friends."
5,"Never thought I could love a backpack With the dreaded reminder of College exams and papers due every time I see a backpack I never thought I could love it. Targus somehow makes me. Aside from being just a good looking pack with the solid black and contrasting dark greys the backpack functions to a level I'd never had with any others. The size is perfect and the very adjustable straps let you really adjust how it sits on your back. The mesh backing also really prevent it from heating up quickly. It still does when I'm using it on hot days and walking a long distance, but no where near as bad as most packs.  I bought this mainly for a laptop I own. The back compartment is for a laptop with a padding slot that easily fits your PC and a Velcro strap that you can fasten to prevent it from moving. The same compartment has a pocket of mesh that I use for cables, my mouse sometimes etc and a lot of extra room. The handle (which completely caught me by surprise) is solid plastic with a metal wire inside and a rubberized grip over top. This plastic does not move at all! The handle itself moves but the the construction is not going to let weight affect it. In short (because there is so many) there is a large main pocket with another mesh inside pocket, a smaller pocket in the front that leads further down and another lower pocket at the bottom with many different compartment for cellphones etc. I store anything from calculators, erasers, sharpeners etc in this.There is also two side pockets right above the double water bottle mesh holders.  On top of the laptop section, there is two pockets that I love. Absolute genius by Targus's part, it really is the small things that make the pack. There is a small pocket in between the handle and the laptop pocket. It isn't overly large but it is fully lined with a extremely soft material, I want to say cotton but I have no clue with fabrics. Sorry. I store my cellphone and any electronics in this pocket. Because it's so high up nothing ever bumps the devices and the material is so soft I don't even find it leaving scratches on anything. It is very clever. The second is a long almost hidden pocket that opens up behind one of the mesh backings at the bottom of the backside of the pack. At first I really couldn't think of any reason to use the pocket until I thought of storing your wallet, passports or any documents/items you want kept safe in it. Why? Because the pocket is against your back at all times. The only way someone behind you could potentially steal something would be physically taking the entire pack off you. A very nice feature I found in case your carrying any valuables.  Overall an outstanding backpack. I've warn it for an entire semester since purchase carrying textbooks, my laptop and multiple other things and there isn't even a slight showing of wear on any section. As well as even with everything I'm carrying it does start to get a decent weight but I really don't feel any strain on my back. I was originally skeptical on paying $60 for a backpack but the way Targus makes them, I'd pay even more for the Drifter II if I had too."
5,"LAPTOP CHRISTMAS GIFT"
5,"LOVE THIS BACKPACK! I was looking for a bag to fit my 15.6"" work laptop and this does the job! A lot of the messenger bags out there only fit laptops smaller than 15"". I decided to try out a backpack, instead of putting weight on one of my shoulders with the typical laptop bag. The bag is very chic and well made. It is padded to protect your electronics. There are so many pockets to organize material. It is very convenient for travel as well!"
5,"Great for houses with sleeping babies or pets. Nothing terribly fancy here--a working compact micro, but thank heavens for that mute function!  I don't have to cover my ears or stop the machine with one second left to avoid obnoxious, piercing beeps."
2,"Defective product The cable to charge came faulty."
3,"Not like it was but still works well We just opened our 2017 purchase of this hand blender, our previous one finally died. The 2017 was the third hand blender of this model we have owned. We use them multiple times a day every day so 3 in 14 years is pretty good. I like how this blends, it's strong and it rinses well. I do not like the new feature of dual buttons to activate it! I am petite (5'2"") and my small hand has trouble/awkwardness holding down the top and front button to get this to work. It's also more difficult to click together, it has to be aligned just right and so is not the easy assembly in 1 second that is used to me. It's still fast but it's added seconds to it's use and I really don't like the dual button to operate. We probably will find another brand or model next go around."
1,"NOTTTTTT SLOW FLOW!!!!!!! This is not slow flow.  Bought the avent 2 pack bottles locally. Thought my baby was a little piggy, till I realized flow was too heavy and formula was leaking under her little neck.  Instead of throwing out the bottles, I decided to replace the nipple.  Searched amazon specifically for avent slow flow nipples.  Received item, sterilized and replaced.  Instinct said to check flow.  Formula came out in a steady stream.  So annoyed.  Ended up having to order new set of bottles (with real slow flow nipples), so as not to baptize my baby in formula.  Please label these correctly.  THEY ARE NOTTTTT SLOW FLOW!!!!"
1,"THIS INK IS A SCAM AMAZON I WANT MY MONEY BACK I don’t want to give this ink any stars!! I bought it on May 18. I like having extra on hand so I don’t run out. I changed to this ink cartridge on July 12th. I was printing an important document I had to send to my siblings to sign and return to my Attorney in regards to my Fathers Estate as I am the Executor. The ink DID NOT print black, it was the brownish color you get when the cartridge is running low. Not satisfactory!!! I tried installing it 3 different times with the same results. Finally I gave up and ran to Walgreens and bought a new one. Of course this one works. Then I then read all the reviews.  Who needs to read reviews on an HP ink jet cartridge? ME!! Who knew!!! I can’t believe all of these reviews that are saying the cartridge they bought didn’t work either. This has never happened to me before!! I WANY MY MONEYBACK!!! WHAT KIND OF SCAM IS THIS? Please reply to me and make this right!!"
4,"Not as water resistant as I would like. Set a couple of cold water bottles inside my back and see it in my lap for a bus tour. It looked like I wet my pants.  They're light, easy to pack, but they're not water resistant.  I love the pockets for storage. Especially the inside pouch for things like your wallet or passport for traveling."
4,"Spare hip span, very high scratchy waist band These pants are a slightly small fit. I am 5 4, 115lbs. I bought size 6. They fit okay, but tighter in spots than most size 6 pants that I buy. The seam at the knee is not bothersome but noticeable. What is bothersome is the waistband. It becomes scratchy and annoying when you start sweating. It also fits very high. I prefer a mid-rise waistband and these are high-waisted.  I think if they hadn't scrimped in the hip area, the waistband would move with the body more freely.  I wore these pants to walk the dog and did not notice any discomfort with the waistband. It wasn't until I wore them to take a long walk and began to sweat that it became uncomfortable.  The pockets are not generous and will not fit a large phone. They fit on the hip bone rather than down the front of the hip, not a favorite pocket style for me."
4,"Update to follow Space saver on the counter. Aesthetically pleasing. Heats my tea water in same time as larger micro. Light green is Very close to aqua. Does Not scream green. Unless perhaps you’ve got it next to a true blue/light blue. My Corelle Dinner plates fit, My 160z Starbucks tall white mug fits height-wise. There is no mention of a memory function others mention in the other colors. Really need that. It sounds as if some reviewers have opinions about the function of the eco button. The manual does not describe Exactly what they mean by “eco”. I’m Leary of the fact that we can feel air coming out of the front door when it’s running. I replaced my previous microwave bc little ants were able to get inside with the door shut. Didn’t seem microwave energy would be safely sealed inside. Now with this oven, feeling air coming through the door between handle and knobs, there’s little peace about that. Called manufacturer number in the manual, 866-646-4332, located in NJ. Tech said it was normal and okay. But... I don’t know. I will update my review after I purchase a tester that detects radiation specifically for microwaves (lol-if they’re to be trusted- cheap little devices)."
5,"** UPDATE ** 3/25/19 - Great and works as expected (Original: ""Good, but not durable"") ** UPDATE ** 3/25/19 The new backpack has performed as expected.  This newer version seems to be much more durable than the last one.  I carried all the same items as before and have not had any issues. Lastly, I would like to add that this pack distributes the wait of what I'm carrying pretty well.  I don't have any shoulder pain carrying it while full. I updated this review to 4 stars since the customer service was excellent and the product is performing as expected.  I would also like to thank the manufacturer for voluntarily sending me a new backpack.  I did not ask for it, yet they did it nevertheless.  ** UPDATE ** 2/24/19 Received an email from the manufacturer for this item and they offered to send another backpack to me.  It was completely unsolicited and unexpected; and I'm very appreciative for their level customer satisfaction.  I attached photo of both packs.  The one on the right is the new one they sent me.  I will come back here in 30 days and give the new one an honest review.  -----------------------------------  I don't review much of anything because I usually am okay with most of what I buy.  This backpack replaced a satchel I used for work.  I’ve had it since September and only ever use it to carry some books, a lightweight laptop (15”), and a Microsoft Surface tablet; and it’s already starting to come apart (see pictures).  I guess I expected a little better durability for the price.  Other than that, the item is good and meets my needs."
5,"Pockets galore and sturdy zippers and straps. I think I'm going to be very happy with this bag. All of the zippers are sturdy and are not flimsy at all. The flap closes over the zipper and secures with magnets which protects from theft. The straps are sturdy as well and look like they're going to hold up over time. There is plenty of room in the bag itself and has plenty of room (and an extra padded section) for a smaller sized laptop. Plenty of pockets inside and out."
5,"Baby loves it I have always used dr brown bottles and my daughter is 8 months old now so decided to give this a try. She loves it"
5,"Great value As expected—definitely buy!"
5,"Stunning necklace excellent customer service! Loved the necklace its beautiful it was for my daughters 11th birthday and she absolutely loved it! The packaging was so wonderful came with a bag and a little card and the necklace was wrapped so it wouldn't tarnish. Also came with a cleaning rag. The customer service was beyond helpful. She went out of her way to make sure I got it in time and even had the necklace made to fit my daughter. He was very prompt at getting back with me  Highly recommend her and this necklace."
5,"Most Comfy I've owned a lot of quality socks over the years, but none that can compare to the comfort and durability of these socks."
5,"HUGE!!!!! My 26 L backpack (of a different brand) recently developed a hole in the bottom of it, so I bought this to replace it.  I should mention my last backpack developed its hole after carrying around my computer which has a jagged edge for nearly 2 years.  That being said, my laptop (13.3"") fits perfectly in this backpack.  The padding of the laptop compartment has a hole in it at the bottom due to the jagged edges of my laptop, but, for the average laptop that hasn't been dropped and had parts fall out, I expect this wouldn't happen.  This backpack has storage for everything you could possibly need and more!  I got it for college and it handles all my textbooks, laptop, water bottles, spare change, extemporaneous crap (tape, pens, beanie, spare clothes, headphones, etc.) and that leaves one compartment completely empty!  There is no reasonable thing that this bag cannot fit in some capacity.  One time it held a 20"" pot like a champ.  If you're a ridiculous, prepared for everything, always hauling stuff, this bag is for you!  I bought this about 5 months ago and, while college makes my life chaos, it is a dependable, sturdy bag that will bring peace of mind."
5,"Well-made athletic leggings I got these for jogging. I was looking for a warmer legging for the fall months, and these are definitely warm. They aren't fleecy at all, but just a thick, strong fabric that is very insulating. They seem extremely well stitched, a true athletic legging. Not only that, the 4 way stretch is quite remarkable. They looked like capri length out of the box but magically stretched all the way to my ankles with stretch to spare. My one issue (arguably a positive) is how compressing they are. I am 5'3"" and 120 lbs., and I bought the small. These things hug me like a boa constrictor. I have a little belly pooch, and the top of the pant is basically a waist trainer on me. Same with the thighs. If you are looking for extreme compression, go with your normal size. If not, I would size up."
5,"Works great! I homeschool and this pencil sharpener has been great for home use. It's probably not great for constant use with 20 students, but for home and sharpening every once in awhile it's been working great and I have had no issues with it."
5,"but was pleased about the length of the cord Had much hesitancy in purchasing, but was pleased about the length of the cord. Also, the delivery was fast. I would definitely recommend."
5,"Replacing one Ninja with another....and happy about it!!! OK, so fair warning....I'm a NinjaFan(tm).  Between the multi cooker, the grill, and my original blender I'm very much in danger of being a gushing fanboi when I say Ninja has never let me down.  The Duo is something that, frankly, replaces my original Ninja blender.  Where I thought the first blender was awesome, along comes Ninja to kick things up to a pretty crazy level.  In fact, while I make use of a vacuum juicer the Duo gives me enough where I'm comfortable replacing that thing too.  I'll say at first I was a little hesitant...I mean, my old blender had blades that covered several levels in the blending jar, and this one....doesn't.  Will it work as well?  Do I need to worry?  Turns out no, I didn't need to worry at all.  The power is here, the blade design is solid, and the engineering is such that it adds versatility and performance to my kitchen counter.  The main event here is the juicing functionality, and that's one I've been playing with for awhile. Main thing....it's not *technically* juicing so much as grinding up the fruit or whatever and passing it through a chinois-looking screen.  But I'm not a technical person, heck all I want is some good orange juice.  This method DOES require a little more attention, in that you don't just put in a bunch of peeled orange wedges...the end result is much too thick.  You'll need to experiment with your preferred ratio of fruit, water, and ice (yes, ice....trust me) to get the viscosity of the drink to your taste.  Fortunately the Duo makes that pretty simple, and by simple I mean ""load up the jar hit a button and sit back"" simple.  Yeah, it has programmed blend times and such to automate this as much as possible.  Easy.  But frankly juicing is only a fraction of what I do with a blender.  I mean, I'm not a lush or anything but I do go for bulldog margaritas and this thing does very well.  It crushes ice quite nicely and there's enough versatility to let me get the kind of grind I really want.  Moreover, having the smaller blending glass is extremely handy....I make the margarita in that, pop the top, put in a Corona beer bottle and sip my worries away.  So plenty of options with this thing.  It does heavy jobs with the same efficiency and power that it brings to the smaller jobs.  The base has suction cups to keep the whole thing stable, so much so that I'm now out of the habit of keeping one hand on the blending jar while in use.  I will say it's not all perfect - but this is more a *me* thing.  I mean, it has a vacuum pump and whatever you think about the value add there you have to know that it is....noisy.  It's like a Food Saver on a giant heavy metal amplifier.  End result is marvelous of course, but just be aware that there's a certain decibel level here that may be uncomfortable.  When you get right down to it, there's nothing in the way of regular or even irregular tasks that I threw to the Duo that it couldn't handle, and handle well.  As I said, it replaced my Ninja blender and I do NOT find myself longing for the old days.  It's that good.  A very well done product."

5,"Excellent for cleaning electronics I use this putty for cleaning my AirPods. They work wonders for removing the hard-to-reach ear gunk (for lack of better words). The putty goes a very long way and is overall good value."
2,"Picture shows laminator The last picture shows it with the laminator I assumed it was the laminator pouches"
3,"Too hot for running Too thick and not tight enough in the support areas.  Good for winter socks if you have enough room in your boots.  They are comfy and give a little extra bad in running shoes, but just too thick and hot for me."
3,"Sweatshirt top The top is nice, but the material is thinner than a sweatshirt."
1,"Avoid this Budget Garbage Given the price and off-brand manufacturer, I went in with low expectations. Nonetheless, they fell short. From the first use, they faded and dropped connection after just a few minutes. Thinking maybe the battery hadn’t charged well, I tried several more times over a week, and continued to experience the same thing, with sound fading and randomly dropping connection. They sounded good when they worked, but that was infrequent. I’ve gone through a lot of cheap ear buds with running, but these are definitely the worst. They’re headed back."
1,"Doesn’t work at all I bought this along with a headphone adapter for my iPhone. The first issue I noticed right away was that none of the 4 included earbud tips would fit in my ears properly, and would constantly fall out while listening. Two other problems that I had with them was that audio would only play out of the left ear and not the right, and the volume adjustment switch on the headphones just straight up wouldn’t work. However, that’s probably just an issue with my pair. With my experience with Beats headphones in the past, I should’ve known better, but the reason I got these was because of a recommendation of the Lightning version for these headphones in an Austin Evans video. My disappointment is immeasurable. And my day is ruined."
4,"If you have a 13"" or smaller laptop this bag is perfect Only problems are small laptop pocket and straps dangle and get caught in wheels. I used some small binder clips to snap the straps up. If you have a 13"" or smaller laptop this bag is perfect"
4,"Compact Case &amp; Crispy Audio I liked how small the charge case was, making it easy and realistic to carry in my pocket. It would be cooler if it had a connection loop to add it to a keychain. Materials feel premium.  The high and mid sound quality was very crisp and dynamic. Bass was decent but not crazy, a given with this small form factor. The volume seemed capped at “just below loud” to me.  If you only wish to use one earbud instead of two, you can only use the right dominant earbud solo. The left won’t operate by itself. Also, the controls are capacitive, not tactile."
4,"Perfect for me Easy to read face. Looks great."
5,"Works well Only issues I had using these was with my printer. If you can figure the printer out these work great! Loved creating my own designs on their website as well. Using these and business cards for our wedding invites &amp; rsvps."
5,"Five Stars Easy to use. No mess."
5,"majic bullet My elderly 96 yr old mom is now living with me.  as her diet/nutritional needs change along with her mental status, I found myself using my big blender alot to make her food portions.  it was too large/deep. much food wasted at the bottom.  a friend loaned me the majic bullet.  oh my......within 3 days i found myself searching to make the purchase.  It is small but mighty!!!  takes up very little space on my counter.  i could not speak more highly of this product.  i also make my mom smoothies with yogurt.  the cups with covers are great just to pop the left over in the refrig. until she wants a little more .  i waste far less food scapping of the sides and now i can make single portions for her so that she will not get bored. I could go on and on......GET THIS PRODUCT......my cousin has one and grinds her coffee beans fresh every morning."
5,"Excellent quality This a beautiful hood with high quality features. The fans are somewhat loud, but not really any louder than our previous over-the-range microwave hood. With this hood at least you know it is actually getting the exhaust out of the house."
5,"Arrived damaged but still usable This is a great little bag. Sadly mine had been exposed to high heat and the edges of the expanding sides are stuck together. It is usable but life got in the way of exchanging it. I never contacted the seller so I don't know how to recommend anyone avoiding this happening in a future purchase. Hope this helps someone. Perhaps it should be purchased in the winter to avoid hot cargo holds?"
5,"This bag is great! You aren't going to find it cheaper than ... I purchased this as a gift, but I own it as well. This bag is great! You aren't going to find it cheaper than Amazon either. Plenty of organized storage, and built solid. I've used as my carry on bag to a trip to Disney world, and carried at the parks. It's comfortable for all day wear. You won't be disappointed in this pack."
5,"Excelente Compre size Small para mi hija de 11 años , pesa  al rededor de 105 los y le quedó perfecto,  tenía miedo porque es para adulto pero le quedó muy bien.. la tela es buena calidad ,, fresca , tiene bolsillos grandes y mi hija me dijo que se siente comoda  para hacer movimientos  de baile.. muy buena compra"
5,"Great earbuds! (as advertised).. My review... **Disclaimer** I was offered these earbuds at no cost for my honest evaluation. The review below is of my honest opinion with no bias for or against the seller. I have not read any other reviews for this.  I listen to/make music in various settings (e.g., active/passive listener, amateur audio engineer, naturally curious about/interested in sound devices, amateur musician). I am not a pro tester/evaluator, but am very conscious of the various attributes and considerations potentially important to a general user or experienced user (I feel I am of both).  BOTTOM LINE: I really like these 'LETSCOM D32' wireless earbuds and will continue using them until my experience changes. And, I believe the price to be fair (~$45 advertised at the time)  DETAILS: Packaging: Exterior box is simple with no fluff. Interior is simple also, however, it was not obvious that the charging cable, instruction, and extra silicon pieces are on the bottom underneath the tray... maybe to a positive, I didn't sense any loose pieces/parts when lightly shaking the box prior to opening (i.e., good packaging). The manual was easy to understand and the instructions were spot on.  Earbud Housing/Casing: The earbuds are stored in a nice black container. One issue I have is with taking the earbuds out of the container, due to lack of any decent grip. The rim is just plastic... would be better if there was some soft lip/rim to the back for better grip to counter the magnetic pull of the earbuds to the base container.  Look, Fit, &amp; Feel:  These earbuds do look good (certainly not bad IMO). If not paying attention, it's not easy to tell which bud fits in which ear. after initially looking around, I did eventually find the L/R markings near the charging connector lead area... need good lighting to see the markings. These earbuds are not heavy in the palm, which is good for the ear. At the same time, the lightness and shape can make the earbuds easily slip out of the fingertips. After first looking how to place (back “bulb” pointed upward..see manual), I was able to fit it well.... was soft and comfortable. And the silicone really helps seal (cuts down other sound even with nothing playing yet). And unlike other earbuds that hang on the intertragic incisure (bottom notch above ear lobe), such as the Apple ear buds, these silicone type of earbuds AND of the ""up""-pointed ""bulb""-type piece, require the buds to be fitted/seated snuggly in the ear canal entrance to stay anchored and may require adjustments to stay so (mine ears tend to get slightly oily, so I had to adjust ""seating"" every few minutes during med-high physical activity (e.g., running), and none if fairly stationary or during low impacting physical movements [e.g., general/fast walking, moving boxes, washing dishes, slow jogging]). And, it was hard to keep this type of earbuds anchored when listening while eating/snacking (quick and wide jaw movements). Was comfortable to wear, even after about 90 mins and mostly at about 2.5 hrs  Usability:Easy to pair, just as instructed in the manual. The D32 has buttons for control functions (e.g., Vol, pause, play, call answer), but must be pressed with decent pressure to trigger, which can be a bit uncomfortable for the ear, since the buds need to be fairly snug in the ear canal entrance for better seal. Might be better to just control directly through the user device (can activate Siri from voice commands via the earbuds.  Sound: Generally sounds good. General to these types of silicone ""sealed"" type of earbuds (not particular to this make/model), I do notice thump sounds during running exercises or noise during jaw movement. Once fitted snuggly, the sound is fuller than standard plastic-only iPhone wired/Airpod earbuds (for example comparison)... noticeably more bass sound (and perceived feel), though has slightly less highs. Has good audio from phone calls as well, though was told a few times that my speaking was hard to hear (i.e., mic quality wasn't great?), even though I know I was speaking softly. I didn't notice degradation in sound quality, even when with about 45 ft in between the earbuds and my phone source and various objects in the surrounding area (metal shelves, fridge, walls, gym equipment).   Battery - easily last nearly 3 before the low battery notification (""battery is low, please recharge"") was heard (good feature!), and was able to continue listening for 15 mins until I decided to recharge it (I don't recommend letting the battery completely deplete). The 3+ hours were of mostly continuously use with with various music/videos, long conference calls, and more music.  Durability/Life: not tested"
5,"Great for sensitive ears Lots of great earrings. My daughter kept on losing hers so this is great! Her ears got infected from her old ones these had NO PROBLEMS!"
5,"She is Sparkly and comfy don't hesitate Yellow gold eternity ring size 6 is perfect for replacing my expensive diamond one. Wish they offered half sizes bc its a bit big but who am i to complain over a ring that's seemingly real diamonds for under $15? Contemplating getting this one? Don't bc She is sparkly, comfortable and believable."
5,"Good baby handles My four month old son is starting to show interest in touching and holding his bottles, but he obviously needs some help.  He hasn’t mastered these handles yet, but he does grab them when he drinks.  They fit perfectly on the original bottles.  I love the color, as well.  I’m not picky when it comes to what colors my son’s bottles, pacifiers, etc. are.  If you are, this color would be good for a boy or a girl. The easiest way to use these is to stretch it over the top and slide it down.  It is easy to clean."
5,"I am feeling like my old self again To say this product is life-changing is an understatement! At 42, I have been suffering from a variety of hormone related symptoms for at least a year. The biggest and most debilitating was the mood swings and anxiety (which seemed to come out of nowhere) and really heavy, clotty periods. After the first week of using this cream twice a day, I am feeling like my old self again. What an incredible relief! I look forward to continued success in the coming weeks and months as my hormones continue to balance. If you are one the fence...TRY IT! Trust me, I spend months and months trying every supplement out there. Nothing has worked like this."
5,"Amazon delivery Great product ,would order more if... Amazons people who deliver can’t ready address even when house has big numbers on it!! My package was left at neighbors house while we where at home and the an hour later my wifes package came from Amazon with a whole different driver🤬"
2,"Unacceptable print quality What is wrong with this toner cartridge? I have never had horizontal streaking issues with my Brother TN660 before, not until I bought a couple cartridges from Amazon. I've tried everything in the book to clean the printer per manual instructions. Tried alcohol wipes to the drum and other parts. Nothing resolves this, so this is a defective cartridge. Not happy. I'll purchase from another supplier."

4,"Amazing technology far outweighs minor deficiencies Bose has managed to combine the lightweight feel of earbuds with the amazing functionality of headphone-grade noise cancellation. On top of that, they have added the novel technology of controllable noise cancellation - all of these factors combined should propel the QC30 to a five star range - but some inherent problems bog it down.  There are real problems, as other reviews here and on Reddit have mentioned, with the microphone. I've tested it on both the receiving and calling end, and it is bad enough to warrant taking off a star from the review. The battery life also causes a bit of an inconvenience as it's not possible to use them while charging, but it's not a deal breaker.  The controllable noise cancellation is, simply put, amazing. The headphones not only reduce the noise cancellation at lower settings (levels 1-4), but also amplify external sound. This is one of the greatest perks of these headphones - I can, for the first time, listen to music and still carry on clear conversations with people around me or enjoy ambient noise of the nature. This is the key feature that sets the QC30 apart from the QC35 and QC20, both of which I own, as in both of them when you turn off the noise cancellation feature, the structure of the earpieces still keep most sound from being heard. Controllable noise cancellation is definitely the technology of the future.  I found the effectiveness of noise cancellation at the higher settings (levels 10 - 11) to be comparable to the 20 and even 35. If you're having second thoughts about buying these due to fears about ineffective noise cancellation - like I did - I can assure you that those fears are unwarranted."
4,"Perfect for small hands! Very lightweight, and great for small projects This heats up fairly quick. My first impression was that it was lighter and thinner than I expected. (You can see in my photos a few views). I have pretty tiny hands, but still feel like my hand encompasses it all. There is a small metal stand that helps keep the glue gun standing up to keep the metal nozzle from resting on surfaces, however, it only keeps it approximately 1/4"" off of the surface. Also, since the ""kickstand"" is about as thick as a paperclip, it is very movement sensitive and will easily knock over if your table or surface isn't 100% solid and still. I personally don't mind, as I use silicone hot glue gun mats to protect my surfaces. so I can lay down my glue guns when I'm working quickly.  I have also included a photo of my other glue guns for comparison. My pink one is a small $3.00 one from the craft store cashier's counter that I grabbed when I let a friend borrow my heavier duty blue one on the right side of the picture.  It is great that this comes with 25 glue sticks. These particular glue sticks are too large for my small glue gun and too small for my large glue gun.  The trigger is easy to use, and it feeds glue just as well as any other typical cheap or pricey glue gun. There is an on/off switch, which is a wonderful feature for glue guns, so that you don't need to unplug them every time you want to turn them off. The swivel feature was not really helpful for me, as it was not turning easily. It actually is very tight and doesn't move as freely as I had hoped.  I do wish the kickstand was a little more sturdy or for the hand grip to have some sort of flat standing support, like my larger glue gun has. The cord is not very long, so you'll need to make sure you're working fairly close to a wall outlet.  This glue gun seems to be similar in comparison to my $3.00 small glue gun (the pink one in my pictures). Although this glue gun has a couple more features than my pink one, the materials are cheaper quality than my smaller glue gun, and may not last quite as long. As for value for price, I am writing this review with the Prime Price tag at $10.99. I feel as though the glue gun &amp; 25 glue stick combo would be more appropriately priced at $6-$8. This would be great for a starter glue gun or for small projects, but if you are going to be using a glue gun often and for many projects, I would suggest investing in a heavier duty one than this.

5,"Awesome So helpful! You need this if you are formula feeding. Dont; even bother with one of those silly expensive machines. You need this! Also, there is no reason why your baby needs warm milk.. we make milk, refrigerate it and then give it to our son cold. We have checked with the pediatrician and my friend who is a APN and it is A okay! Ask your doctor about it and see if baby will take cold milk.. its easier and cheaper to use this if they will take it."
5,"Nice design simple. I liked the product for my children. Leak free and simple design."
5,"Awesome travel cleaner I bought this item when we had a family vacation 5 months ago. This was so handy and doesnt take too much space. I'm so happy that I was able to hand carry it and be able to clean my son and nephew's bottle during our trip. Highly recommended for those who are travelling and doesnt have the option to use a bottle liner."
5,"Easy to use The dispenser is easy to use and the tape is very strong. Keeps boxes closed. There is a good amount of tape on the rolls."
5,"Great Truly Wireless. I purchased these ""Used-Like New"" via Amazon Warehouse to replace my Jaybird Freedoms because the wire kept pulling the buds loose from my ear. They came in great condition. Once I put them in my ears and turned them on they gave prompts for Bluetooth connection. The Jabra sound+ app is helpful and allows for tuning so I would download if you haven't. I'm not sure what some reviewers were complaining about regarding sound volume as I use Sony 950B over ears and find the Jabra Elites to be loud enough for my taste. A tight fit allows for great sound isolation and the hear-through feature is awesome for when I am cycling. I do agree with other reviewers that the case should be magnetized to hold the ear phones securely when you open it as they tend to jump and I can forsee a few falls coming in the future. I would gladly recommend these to anyone who asks. (For now)"
5,"I found the shoulder straps to be quite comfortable after minor adjustment This backpack was purchased to use as a plane carry on and as an overnight bag for intermittent travel.  It proved to work out well for my vacation, but I did not overload it with non-essentials.  Based on the price of the bag, I do not know if this bag would fair well on  day to day usage, such as a student's school bag."
5,"You could REALLY throw this thing if you put your back into it, it's weighty. Really smooth extension and retraction of the tape. It's relatively heavy, in the good way, and seems like it's very durable. Numbers are very easy to read. The locking button is a bit stubborn to get locked into place. It's not too bad but it doesn't easily slide down to lock. Ok, hold on, it does easily slide down to lock but not as ""buttery"" as a $30 tape measure but for $7 I'm very happy."
5,"Great little cross body bag Cute, sturdy, cross body bag. I like all the different pockets/dividers. Reversible wide strap. I bought this to use on my motorcycle. 🏍"
5,"Great, but, wash with Dapple. Dr. Browns has it down. Can’t fault this product, we’ve used it for both our daughters, 18 months and 8 week old. The green thing inside is a pain  wash, however, does what it’s meant to do and reduce gas. We wash ours with dapple, regular washing detergent leaves a strong scent on the bottles and internal parts."

5,"Works well for me! Love the wide-mouthed bottom! I needed to purchase a new smoothie maker after my Bullet I've had for many years started leaking down through the motorized assembly and adjusting the gaskets didn't stop the leak. I came across this HB multi-function blender and purchased it specifically because it had a wide-mouthed bottom and lots of power. I always had problems with my fruit and protein powder getting stuck in the bottom of regular-sized blender jars and not mixing thoroughly. This one doesn't have that issue and works well for me, even with the largest chunks of fruit. Crushes ice cubes just fine, although I do as one reviewer suggests and I put a little liquid in first. The motor is not too loud and it has all the functions I need. I have several Hamilton Beach appliances and would recommend them any day!"
5,"I'm glad I did Took a chance on the Caribbean Blue color since I couldn't find a local retailer that carried it to see it in person before ordering online.  I'm glad I did.  It's a warm blue color that I love and will be easy to spot in a sea of black bags at the airport.  Very pleased with this backpack and will be using it for an upcoming trip to London and Paris so I don't have to hassle with carrying a suitcase up and down flights of stairs."
5,"Headphones work great! I use these throughout my work week, only charge them once a week!! I also use them while I mow my yard and vacuum my car! Awesome noise cancellation! I would recommend!"
2,"Shoulda went w platinum Very thin.  I have a ruby and diamond pendant  it way too thin  I’m afraid of losing it I didn’t realize it can’t be cleaned to shine.  It’s coated w rhodium when that wears off it’ll look dark"
3,"Features awesome but Not sure of notches Features especially the automatic clock adjustment are excellent.  I must have an odd wrist size though because I have to put moisturizer on my wrist for it to be comfortable. After 6 months of wearing it, it seems like one notch is still just a little too loose because the watch can still slide up and down my wrist. The other makes my wrist really sore unless what I’m doing distracts me from it."
1,"Not as good as previous version Not as good as the original, bass is lacking and fitment isnt as good."
1,"Misleading color. Not at all what is pictured. Okay I will have to upload a picture soon so people can see what I'm talking about. But these are not what the image shows. They're darker and when they stretch the color changes. The thread of fabric underneath the top is almost gray? I wanted a compression sock close to my skin color so it would stop drawing so much attention when I wore compression socks with dresses at work. The picture is so misleading. If I didnt hate returning online orders so much I would have returned them. I thought I could trust this brand but apparently not for anything other than the compression and basic black, white and grey. I basically only wear these around the house now or if all my other compression socks are dirty. Dont waste your money. They're good for the feel of the compression bad for like the whole look, so ugly."
4,"fits my space perfect, but the company puts a glued sticker to ... Cute little unit, fits my space perfect, but the company puts a glued sticker to the front of the unit upon removing it leaves a glue spot that's hard to remove, and the dish inside  moves alot,  overall no big issues nice little unit for a little spot."

4,"Four Stars good deal"
5,"Cute Backpack This bag was bigger than I expected but my daughter absolutely loves it. She carries it all over."
5,"Great product, even better company! Absolutely love this product and this company! When I was having problems finding a nipple to work with my little boy, they were more than willing to help make my life as a new mom easier! My breastfeeding journey has been anything but easy, and I can’t express my gratitude for nanobebe being so helpful on this journey!"
5,"Perfect backpack for travel We bought this backpack for my husband to use on our trip to Norway.  It is roomy and rugged and has everything that we need for the trip.  It is perfect for our purposes and at a great cost."
5,"Soft sweater It is very soft and feels so good on.  I read reviews and ordered two sizes up and I am so glad I did.  I find it runs two sizes to small.  But definitely worth the purchase."
5,"Perfect match for Chemex These filters work perfect for my Chemex carafe....probably because they were designed for it.  O"
5,"We love it! I saw this at the Guess door ave loved it fit my husband. I hit it for his birthday ads he loved it too. It was a good buy."
5,"K cup Tea and Coffee Love. LOVE THESE FILTERS!!!! Love this it's a 4 pack and the price is Great. I never new I can brew tea and have it taste so much better just buy using a K cup with no wet tea bag clean up. I rip open my tea ,put a lol water on my tea for moisture (optional) and single brew me a delicious cup of tea and when i want coffee I just use a different filter as to not mix taste but no matter my morning pick me up it's full strength and delicious."
5,"Hands down the best one on all of amazon If you are looking for a backpack to use as a suitcase, this is it.  You can use it to carry, or pull out the straps and carry it on your back.  The straps tuck away so they aren’t dangling when you are carrying it.  It has a boatload of room and is really well thought out.  The quality of this backpack Is even better than I thought it would be.  It is definitely worth the money, without a doubt.  If you are a smaller stature, the jr version might be better.  I am 5’9 and the full size is just right."
5,"Light weight, soft compression, effective I may suffer from restless leg syndrome at times. I discovered that compression socks have tended to help me combat the effects of my legs needing to move in order to feel comfortable. I ordered these socks due to the high reviews. They are not as tight as my other pair, but they are comfortable. They are soft. The true test will be how well they ease my leg discomfort after I run, which is when my legs tend to be the most painful at night. I have never run with compression socks on, but these ones are fairly light that I may give it a try."
5,"Great Blender I bought this back in March and wanted to wait a while before I posted my review.  I really like this blender and chopper.  The blender is very strong and makes great smoothies.  I can throw in whole pieces of ice from my ice tray and it just grinds them up with no problem.  I know some people don't like the cover because it is so tight and can be a problem to get off.  I solve that problem by just putting the cover on lightly,  If I'm blending something that I am afraid will shoot out I just hold the cover down with my hand...no problem.  The chopper is a nice addition.  Its chops small amount of vegetable when I don't want to get out my big food processor."
5,"Definitely buy these Seriously sooo comfortable! Need to buy another set so I have twice as many to wear!"
5,"Its printer paper This is a pretty straightforward purchase. It prints just fine both color and black ink. Arrived safely - though, fun story, it was raining cats and dogs the day this was delivered so if I wasn't home when it arrived, it would have been damaged by the rain because there wasn't any additional packaging in the box (which is fine, less waste). So advice: if you don't have a spot on your porch that can protect it from rain, and it's supposed to rain that day, just wait to order (or be home)."
5,"Great customer service UPDATE:  Customer service with Anker has by far been the best experience I've ever had with an Amazon vendor. They are very helpful and attentive to all my needs and was able to resolve any issues I had without a headache. A side from the battery life, these earbuds are great quality and even sound alittle better then my Powerbeats. Will definitely purchase through Anker again.  So I was sent two pairs of these ear buds.  The first pair was defective. The battery life jumped from 60% to 20% to dead in less than 30 minutes of the first use. Customer service was very helpful and sent me another pair. On the second pair, the battery life seems to be better but for how long they last, it takes a long time for the battery to charge which is annoying. I bought these to use at work so I wouldn't have to use my PowerBeats. But considering how long it takes to charge (almost two hours) and battery life lasting maybe at most six hours, its not really worth it."
5,"Easy to use Cheap. Works. Comes off nicely."
2,"It was the cheapest and new but quality control issues Ordered this since I tried other brand that was more expensive and this was cheaper and new. When using product, noticed some capsules in the bottle had brownish coloring and contacted company and was sent replacement with the same issue and other black colored debris, smh. So that bottle will be returned and I'll go try another brand."
3,"Not as large as you would think I got this for my work laptop and even though the dimensions are correct- my laptop BARELY fits. I have to force it and pull the material up over my laptop. It's so secure once it's in, but it's a full on hassle to get it inside my backpack. Additionally, I haven't had this that long (only a month or so) and already the faux leather is starting to rip off. Not cute. I really love the look of this bag and I get complements on it often, but functionality wise, go with something else!"
3,"The cover is not as flexible as some other brands! Like the set-up of the book, note space, and additional space if needed. Not as flexible as I had hoped. Not the end of the world. I will use it!"
1,"Nothing like the picture The skirt I was sent looked nothing like the picture. It has gathers all around the front instead of the lovely large pleats on the skirt shown. It's for an actor's costume and I'm embarrassed to try it on her because it looks unflattering. Most likely will be returned."
1,"DOES NOT COME AS ADVERTISED!! Doesn’t even say the message it said it was going to come with, that’s the only reason I bought it!"
4,"Good but tight These are as shown but they are very very tight for someone who actually has meat on their bones."
4,"I like it... I definately like the watch but I am not flattered by the band base on the cost of this watch. The band somewhat disappoint and appears rather cheap. Nevertheless, I like everything else."
5,"Best 'disposable' mechanical pencils out there After clinging onto this type of mechanical pencil whenever I found it laying around, I finally decided to buy some for myself. These are by far my favorite mechanical pencils. Their erasers are some of the best out there and they're cheap. If you're having second thoughts because you don't want sparkly pencils, don't worry about it, you can barely tell. For the price and for the ease of replacement, I'd pick these every time."
5,"Super cute gifts idea! These are so much fun! I ordered them as part of a welcome gift for the moms in the moms group I am a part of. Each pair is unique and a great gift that is small but keep worthy. I am excited to give them out this year and see the reactions."
5,"LIFE. SAVER. 10/10 DO RECOMMEND 10/10. Fixes BV within days. Sometimes doctors have no idea why your vag smells (not their fault, not everyone specialized in gynecology) so instead of testing your pH they’ll just test for STI’s and send you home with a prescription for broad spectrum antibiotics or antivirals, which is the last thing our population needs right now...  Turns out it’s really just as simple as eating a diet that is too acidic or too basic, unknowingly changing your body’s pH and blam before you know it you’ve got a little funk going on in the southern parts of lé body. Thankfully it’s as easy as a suppository every few days until symptoms resolve. No doctors visits, no breaking the bank. Thank the LAWD for feminiva."
5,"Five Stars So much better than 2.50 a cup at a restaurant"
5,"high quality product and great after sell service high quality product and great after sales service. I tried coffee enema but my body didn't have a good response. :("
5,"Fantastic value. Highly recommended. I was pleasantly surprised on opening the box by the apparent quality of the headphones themselves, as well as the charging case. The overall design is sleek and the case has a little weight and seems durable.  As for the headphones themselves, the sound is as good as I would ever need. Although I mostly only listen to podcasts, I made sure to listen to a variety of music and I have to say that it sounds fantastic. I could easily pick up all the frequencies that I would expect.  For the price, I can't imagine a better pair of headphones than these."
5,"Easy to use. The directions were straight forward! There is no “flavor” in this cleaning process. Just get it all cleaned out."
5,"Overall love the pants good quality Fit as expected. Just had a little bit of a smell.  But I washed it first before wearing it."
5,"Worth the price I’m still testing these out, so I may update this review later. For now I’ve only tested these for listening to music, not calls.  This comes with three extra sizes of the little plastic ear bud pieces, so four sizes total. It also comes with an adorable little magnetic case. It doesn’t have a cover, but I’ve thrown these into my bag the last two days without a problem, the magnet is pretty strong. It also has a very short charging cable (a wall plug is not included), it’s the perfect length to keep by my laptop at work, no need to worry about it getting in the way.  Often I walk away from my desk and forget my phone. I was about 20 feet away before my music stopped playing this morning. Someone mentioned they had trouble walking more than a foot away and I find that hard to believe.  The bass is good, as well as the noise cancellation. Super easy to pair. You take it out of the case and it turns on, you select the Bluetooth feature on your phone and select the ear buds separately. After that, they automatically connect each time you take one out of the case.  You can use both, just the left, or just the right at a time. Battery life is good for the cost. I’ve been getting about 4 hours per bud. I wear one at a time, so while one is in my ear, the other is charging. The case itself does charge when not connected to a power source for up to 15 hours, but I haven’t tested that feature much yet.  They stay put. I didn’t want to spend much on an expensive brand since I have a toddler that would easily grab them out of my ear. If these were lost or were damaged I would absolutely purchase another pair. Worth every penny."
5,"This watch is so beautiful. The watch came in a large box that ... This watch is so beautiful. The watch came in a large box that was secured with buble packaging around the watch inside its original box. I love the way this watch looks and I used YouTube to set up which was pretty easy."
5,"Installation was done by a professional I really enjoy using my Cosmo Island Mount Range Hood as it's performance is amazing.  This is my first range hood and I use it daily especially when I am grilling or sautee on my stove-top that creates a lot of grease or smoke."
5,"Great product... great color (red)... great price. I have always been a bit leery about microwaves, just for safety issues, but I still used them. It was time for a new one, and this had some great reviews on various sites. I have to say that I really like it. Aside from my loving the Metallic Red color, there are various options for cooking different items, along with the standard timing, as well as a power control so you're not just pulsing full power on and off. This helps to prevent boil-overs. And there is a defrost. All in all, for the more simpler things that I needed it for, this works great, and I now have options for other cooking as well. All for a really nice price."
5,"GREAT PURCHASE AND VALUE! EASY SET UP AND PERFECT FOR MY ONLINE BUSINESS. I have this set up on my desk for quick weight and label printing using the battery operated feature versus the wall plug.  I have occasionally moved it from my desk to my office floor to weigh large boxes. The hold feature is amazing when the large box blocks the screen. I simply reach under the box to the side and tap the hold button, remove the large box from the unit and enter my info to print the label. I've had it for a few weeks now with no major issues. The auto shut off after a few mins is great as I usually forget to turn things off. Even then the stock batteries included are still functional.  My only concern is the stand feature. The top of the scale can be lifted up to position tall boxes or items that need to be standing to weigh. It occasionally sticks making it difficult to open up and use that feature that I'm afraid to break it if i tug too hard. I don't use it often so it's not a big deal but definitely something to note.  I've already recommended it to a few other small business owners and will re-purchase if needed but I think it will last a long time."
2,"look elsewhere for a similar device trying to put the earpiece on is very cumbersome.  The instruction on how to use the phone was very incomplete.  I had to contact others I know who has this device on how to set up my phone.  The earpiece does not fit snugly into my hear.  People state I sound ""tinny"".  I am very dissatisfied and if I could return this product, I surely would!"
3,"I want a replacement. Hi dear invicta. My wife bought this for me and I loved it but sadly after a trip to Peru I found out it it wasn't water proof as promised. Moisture started to show up. The glass is broken. I am wondering if you could replace the glass or do something with this. Now it's just sitting in my suitcase. Sad end for a nice watch. Please reply if you can. I makes me sad leaving it inside a case."
1,"Not good at all Tastes like they used a very cheep extract to flavor the coffee. Has a very strong chemical after taste. I will not reorder this again"
1,"Terrible cheap quality I don't know why this paper gets such positive reviews. It's super thin and see-through. For some reason all the paper curls after it prints, so it won't lay down flat."
4,"Great Drying Rack for Bottles and Pump Parts We love this drying rack. For our first, we used the Dr. Brown’s drying rack, which didn’t hold pieces as well and the rows would fall down. Also, the Dr. Brown’s drying rack collected water under the top layer and molded quickly.  This rack has none of those issues. It can be run through the dishwasher so it’s easy to clean. The design does not mold (at least not so far - not as easily as Dr Browns). It is easier to use, holds bottles and pump parts easily, and is just a good drying rack.  My one complaint is that I was excited about the cup, which is advertised to hold a bottle brush. It does not hold the brush - our cup does not stay locked to the rack so the weight of the brush pulls the cup over. After days of picking the cup back up, I eventually just took it off the rack and am not using it."
4,"Great item for the price Perfect lightweight “jacket.”  I purchased this for travel. It kept me warm in the plane and for much of my Portland stay. I ordered a medium. 5’4” and 132 lbs. it is a good fit."
4,"Good quality manufacture - Works well. Good quality manufacture. Makes walking in the dark - indoors or out - much easier and hands free. - I have used it an hour or so per day for a week and battery is fine. - Does not adjust accurately enough to be used at a workbench, but then they didn't say it would. - Note that even on lowest setting it's pretty bright. Too bright, maybe, for reading in bed beside a light-sensitive partner. - on brightest setting it's strong enough for finding the dog in the yard on a dark night."
5,"Five Stars Wife purchased this for her best friend for Christmas."
5,"I love this tape dispenser I am so happy that it doesn't have the middle piece that you have to insert through the tape roll.  I've had people accidentally throw that part away then the tape dispenser was useless.  This dispenser is on a swing arm so it's easy to add a new roll of tape and not have to worry about pieces going MIA.  The tape is cut easily.  It is a nice looking dispenser as far as tape dispenser go.  I have bought 3 of these because they are wonderful for the price."
5,"Amazing! I ordered these and got them overnight thank god. I'm on an antibiotic (minocycline) long-term for my skin since it decided that my 30s would be a great time to start with breakouts. I take probiotics, all of that to try to keep yeast infections away. Nope. During my period and after having sex, I tend to get yeast infections (which tends to kill having sex with my boyfriend, not cool). Had sex a couple days ago and dun dun dun, one struck again. Got these and as soon as they showed up in the mailbox, I grabbed them, ran back inside and got the plastic wrapper and seal off and used one. Took less than a half hour and I noticed a ton of relief. I was amazed. I wasn't sure what to expect. By the evening the burning and itching were not even close to as bad as before. No discomfort or burning feeling from them. I used another tonight and my symptoms are gone.  There's discharge when using one but not even close to the amount like when using creams for yeast infections. A panty liner and that's enough. No applicator but they're easy to insert. Wash and dry hands, lay down and put it up as far as possible as a tampon without an applicator. It dissolves completely.  Seriously, buy this if you're having reoccurring problems (and you've seen your doctor so you know it's not something that needs treatment from them but yeah). I wish I'd known about these ages ago."
5,"Great set of earbuds for the money Ok so i will start out to say that these are the best wireless earbuds i have.  I recently bought a pair of jlab jbudz true icon earbuds and i have also used jabra elite 65t earbuds.  The most notable feature on this which seems to be standard now a days is the tws+.  This means that each earbud connects separately to the device so that they can be usd independently.  This was the one lacking feature that stopped me previously from buying another pair after my jabra ones died.  It says in the manual that using the earbuds independent puts them in mono mode.  Honestly they sound the same to me whether using them independent or together.  The manual is my one complaint.  There is barely even one.  The instructions are kind of very vague so if you arent tech savvy then it might take you a minute.  These fit great in my ears.  I use them at the gym, at school and at work.  Never had a problem with them falling out.  The sound is great.  My gripe with my jbudz is that the volume was low and if i was in a noisy environment  it hurt the sound even more.  These have a nice volume, great sound and i can not hear the sound in the background.  The best feature is is the battery life.  I have been using these for 6 days straight and i did not have to recharge this until today and it was not even empty.  Charging uses a usb-c port which is a very nice upgrade.  This means that charging takes way less than all those micro-usb charging ports. Overall this is a great pair of earbuds and i definitely recommend"
5,"Remarkable product! The packaging was very well done, and sealed well so you'd know you really got a brand new product straight from the factory. It comes off with a free 1 year extended warranty. The instructions are concise and the pairing is very easy. The case is very compact and it's dimensions are pocket friendly. The ear buds magnetically snaps into place when you put it in the case. There are extra ear pieces with different size to ensure you can use the right size for your ear so that it doesn't fall off easily. I use the smallest size and it sits perfectly in my ears. The quality of sound is amazing. The battery life last a little over 5hours. I used t10 bass boosted for exercise and still used a wire for normal use. But with this product I am now officially wireless free throughout the day and i don't think I'll ever go back to wires."
5,"Satisfied so far I wore it for the first time today with a black pantsuit and it looked very nice. I like the fact that it’s not too heavy or too light and I was not tugging at it at all.  I did have to press the wrinkles out and don’t know how it will wash &amp; dry yet."
5,"Love it I purchased similar earrings that were not real leather so I like the fact that they are leather. I bought them for gifts, and 1 for myself of course. I am planning to buy spring/summer colors later."
5,"Five Stars Very nice watch, elegant and wonderful . I really love it. The same I was expecting."
5,"Don't need an Apple watch to charge daily, this is perfect. So I considered buying a watch from Apple, they look good, but you have to charge them everyday and read a screen to small, it's hard to get anything done. Just use your iphone or ipad, or computer to get things done. Use your watch to tell time without having to charge everyday. I hike and go on adventures. The last thing I need is for my watch to go out while hiking, so this watch is perfect, solar, altitude, timer, etc., and looks beefy, works for everything."
5,"simple and pretty my mother in law loved it!"
5,"Five Stars Just what I wanted"
5,"great for cooking We’ve been wanting one for the Holidays, and we decided to order this. There’s an option for speed. it also includes measuring cups which can be used for making soup, mashed potatoes, and sauce. It’s easy to clean and to setup. I’m not sure yet with the durability as we’ve used it once."
5,"Ecstatic with the purchase This watch looks absolutlety amazing  if your not sure about the purchase trust me  once you open the  box  and remove the plastic you will feel like a kid on christmas  morning."
2,"Beautiful, but... I LOVE these earrings. They are simple and elegant, great for everyday professional wear. However, the backs are extremely loose and I lost one earring. I want to replace it, especially as these were gifted to me by my boyfriend and you can't purchase just one earring! A lot of other retailers allow you to do so, perhaps for men who only have one ear pierced or if you loose one. Please make this an option! I cried when I lost it."
3,"Front seams irritate my skin When I first tried this on, I loved it – it fit perfectly (34C), it was light in weight and provided great support, and initially felt very comfortable. I almost immediately ordered a couple more - and I'm glad I didn't. As I wore it the next day, I realized that the inner seams on the front cups were irritating my skin, making me feel somewhere between itchy and scratchy. I washed the bra hoping that the seams would soften up, but alas, there is no improvement. I'm so sad – apart from the irritation from the seams, this is a perfect sport bra..."
1,"Frumpy, not sleek Fit was normal in the arms and shoulders, then weirdly huge around the hips. It looked and felt like someone’s old sweatshirt that was stretched out not something brand new."
1,"Sent back Tarnished upon delivery"
4,"The print quality is excellent, however The only reason I gave this product four stars instead of five is because it just doesn't last long enough.  The print quality is excellent, however. I just don't think they put enough ink in these things.  I haven't actually counted my printed pages, but I don't do that much printing, and I have to buy a black cartridge and a color cartridge every month."
4,"Sleek and compact, great for city commuting This backpack has two large compartments of which the front one is rather narrow thus not allowing much bulky packing. The front compartment has several dividers for organizing pens, phone etc and the back one has a laptop sleeve and can fit a little more bulkier items (such as your lunch). This is a great backpack for commuting to work or carrying around the city on a regular day. It's not really designed for travel or hiking. The front ""leather"" material looks great. I initially had some trouble with the front zipper (due to the way the backpack was bent when shipping) but it quickly resolved itself. I highly recommend this item if you are in need of a smaller back pack that looks as good as a briefcase."
4,"The hood is great, but it's very poorly packaged The hood is great, but it's very poorly packaged. I think I just got lucky mine was damaged on the back where it's hidden against the wall. The lights look nice (remember to buy GU10 bulbs) and the fan is pretty quiet. The screws were a little short, so I reused the ones from my old hood."
5,"work as expected They work as expected"
5,"Five Stars Perfect. He loved loved. A year later and it’s survived"
5,"Product is fantastic with above the standard quality and build Shipping was on time and flawless. No damage to boxes everything was packaged neatly and wasn't a hassle at all. Product is fantastic with above the standard quality and build. Material used were high quality and product had no visual or functional defects. Deserves a repeat buy."
5,"Total game changer. This is an absolute godsend.  I spent so much time making up bottles, then warning them etc that my son would become absolutely irate during the wait.  This has changed everything.  It is easy and quick, keeps the bubbles out of the formula, eliminates powder spillage since I don't have to mix in a small mouth bottle, and allows me to pour an odd number of ounces.  No more guessing at a half scoop, or wasting an ounce of expensive formula because I had to make an extra ounce.  Couple this with a bottle warmer or an electric kettle (I have the latter) and the stress reduction is palpable.  Highly recommend."
5,"one tiny issue only thing i’d say is that one of the necklaces that was supposed to be two put together broke but all the other ones were lovely"
5,"Love these shoes I love them"
5,"Love this !!! This is much better than my old vita mix seems to be much stronger"
5,"I love my watch! This is my second Forester Watch and if the first one hadn't been one of the best watches I've had, there never would have been a second purchase. Priced at below $20 it is durable, good-looking, and tough. This has become my go-to everyday watch. It is water resistant to over 300 feet, so I have no concerns when showering, fishing, cooking, washing the truck, etc.  My older one, (still running fine,) has a backlit dial to see the time at night which turns off when you release the button.  This newer one has a light that illumines from below the 6 and slowly dims and goes out like your vehicles' dome light. This is an improvement since you don't have to hold the button down when lit.  It keeps great time, almost 100% accurately.  Mine loses about one minute every few months. Not bad for $20!  It looks great, has an easy to read classic dial and sports a very comfortable band.  Cons? Well the band is nylon fabric and needs occasional cleaning but what doesn't? Also, it probably causes cancer in California, but what doesn't?  You really can't go wrong for yourself with this watch and it makes a great, affordable, gift!  Stop reading and buy it already!"

5,"I really like it. I do wish there was something similar ... I use this at my desk at work as well as my personal office. I really like it. I do wish there was something similar to this with the same number of compartments as well as a section for vertical filing of papers."
5,"Looks higher quality than I paid for I love the way my locket looks on this chain. Thanks!! I know where to go for next time."
5,"looks great looks very nice"
2,"Not the colors I expected. They're fine for what they are, I just wanted some simple stretchy chokers for myself and my wife. However, the colors were not nearly as bright as I thought they'd be, and there's no blue at all. Kinda disappointed."
3,"Just okay, not very impressive. The size of the pearls are as advertised. The color of the pearls were somewhat disappointing. They are kinda cloudy and doesnt look very sparkling."
3,"Work backpack I like the color/size.  It ripped on top and only had it for 3 weeks."
1,"Extremely temperamental I love the idea of this product. I wanted something that was easy to sterilize and dry our baby bottles. A set it and forget it solution if you will. Unfortunately it only delivers on half of the promised functions. I've been using this for about 4 weeks (that's being generous as I think it's actually less than that), and the sterilize function no longer works. The product is on a level surface, and I use only distilled water. I am careful to fill to the appropriate level. Each time water pours out the bottom and the screen changes from blue to red. I basically can only use the dry function at this point. It's really disappointing.  Update: Since writing this I contacted customer service, but I have not received any response. I was able to troubleshoot the problem myself. I had been placing my bottles on the rack after washing them. The little bit of moisture was causing the level of the water to rise. The machine is extremely temperamental, so the whole thing would stop working part way through the cycle. Again, I'm not pleased that water comes pouring out the bottom when this happens, but I've been able to adjust my method to avoid this. I now make sure everything is completely dry before starting the sterilize and dry process. (Enough people have described a similar issue that I thought I would post this in case it might help!)"
1,"To make sure the shoes match with the size Shoe is smaller than the size I ordered"
1,"Not as advertised Go to Home Depot and buy this instead. It's less money and you'll be able to see what you're actually buying. It says that it is ADA compatible but I do not believe it is possible. The controls are on the very top. There's also a photo attached to this product I think by someone who purchased it.  The photo seems to indicate that you could use these as a ceiling mount but  you cannot  reach the controls that way and you have an ugly open back facing someone if you're placing it for example where I was over a kitchen peninsula counter. It really is only for under the cabinet against the wall because the back is not finished. Complete hassle to deal with the seller.  Amazon prime saved the situation and I was able to return it."
4,"small dent in pods lost one star as most pods had a small dent or two in them...so far I'm still able to use them."
4,"Love the longer length The good... I love that the magnet in the ear pieces keep them together. I have several different choices for the size and fit of them. They come with a high quality carrying pouch and an additional tin to hold them. They also come with a mic with volume control. The best part is that they are longer than normal. The bad..... The sound quality is decent. I normally use Skullcandy earbuds. The sound quality of the Klim earbuds are pretty close. They have a slightly tinny sound to them but not too bad. They are definitely lacking in the noise cancelation. If the earbuds are in without sound on, no noise is canceled out. They work a little better if you are listening to music. I would definitely not recommend these if that is very important to you."
5,"Too cute! Big, but not too big. Absolutely love this earring set!"
5,"Five Stars Great Watch"
5,"Super soft and comfortable. What great leggings and they are the perfect length!  Not see thru like some of the cheap ones. I’m a solid size 16 and they are none too tight, a little extra room even."
5,"Good fit, solid material. It's not as good as a SmartWool baselayer, but it's 85% of the quality at 50% of the price."
5,"Exploading Cups?? I'm wondering if anyone else has had problems with the top seal on these k-cups coming off under pressure from the water? I just opened this box of 100 and so far I've had 6 explosions.  I've cleaned enough coffee grounds to think I've either gotten a bad batch or they need to be packed better. Currently, I'm using scotch tape to secure the covers  BTW, I've tried 2 coffee makers with the same result. The coffe itself is very good....first time buying this brand.  After posting this review and processing the return, I was gratified that a replacement was being sent at no charge and no need for me to return the defective product.  I appreciate Amazon's customer service policy and feel it certainly worth 5 stars!"
5,"So many compartments for storage, and compact design This backpack is very compact and it can contain bunch of stuff. Note that you will need your own power bank, and stick it into dedicated area, so you can use USB charging.it has so many useful compartments, but my favorite two: Keychain holder, and a small compartment between shoulder harnesses. This compartment is extremely useful for traveling as it is difficult to reach for pickpocketers, but easy to reach for yourself when you take it out 👌 So you can carry valuables at this small compartment. For this price point, having the USB and earbud openings and the light design, I will say it is a steal!"
5,"Fits perfectly This air filter replaced one that was probably 50 or more years old. It is so nice to see it there in the exhaust fan above my kitchen stove. My kitchen is an oldie but goodie and suits me just fine. There are no wasted steps and no wasted space. It's purely for function and efficiency, and everything is kept in tip top working order. I can get almost everything I need on Amazon."
5,"Balega... remember that name when buying socks! These particular Balegas, the ""Hidden Comfort"" line, they are slightly different than the ""Microbial Sliver"" line, however they are no less comfortable.  In fact, the Hidden Comfort were the first Balegas I ever purchased. I still buy them about once or twice a month, just not as often as the ""Silvers""...  That being said, they are terrific socks. Comfortable, long lasting, stylish. I absolutely endorse buying these socks. I really can't say enough about the entire Balega line of socks. Give them a try, I bet you'll become a fan!"
5,"I have cut fabric with these scissors; and they worked like expensive fabric scissors.  That raised to 5 stars. They are sharp enough to cut my hair; but they are not meant to do so.  My cut hair flew out all over the counter.  UPDATE:  I have cut fabric with these scissors; and they worked like expensive fabric scissors.  That raised to 5 stars."
5,"I put 2 scoops of formula in each compartment and they look like they could likely fit more works well.  I put 2 scoops of formula in each compartment and they look like they could likely fit more.  have not had a problem with it leaking.  the top can be a little stiff and tough to twist, but this likely also prevents it from leaking."
5,"49.8 pounds inside, and still fine to carry! Absolutely wonderful! I've had this bag for over a year now, and I love it! I've brought it as carry-on on many trans-Atlantic flights, as well as two RyanAir flights without problems. I've checked this bag a few times as well. It is easy to spot on the belt. My bag was caught on a wire and tore, but I sent a message to the company, and they replaced it in a week. Absolutely the best customer service I have ever had! I've used the bags constantly, from hiking to traveling to moving, and it is always really great! Sturdy material, sturdy zippers, and a nice locking mechanism allow me to feel secure when I throw it on a luggage rack on the train. It was able to hold all my summer and fall clothes when I studied abroad, along with books. I'm really impressed with the amount of items I can hold in this bag, and still comfortably carry the bag. The straps are comfortable, along with really nice support straps around the chest. (I checked this bag with 49.8 pounds of stuff in it, and still carried it off to my car without extreme shoulder pain.)"
5,"Great little watch! Let me start off by admitting that I normally don't find myself attracted to Invicta watches. They're usually pretty gigantic pieces that scream ""LOOK AT ME!"" as soon as someone steps into a room. That's great if that's what you're going for, but I like more subtle watch faces. Having a small wrist, I wanted to add a diver piece to my collection but didn't want to spend the money I would normally spend on a watch because I thought diver watches would be too big for me. I was completely surprised by how much I fell in love with this watch. It's a 40mm diameter case and, for a diver, that's about as small as they come. I ordered a NATO strap that arrived the same day as the watch and I have never taken the bracelet out of the case. I'm just not a metal bracelet guy. I think the gray and black NATO strap pairs so well with the dial and bezel of this watch. The SEIKO NH35 movement is a reliable and accurate workhorse. This watch keeps better time than my SEIKO 5, has hand-winding, hacking, and a screw-down crown. Honestly, for the price I would have been a fool not to snag it. Also, I don't get why people don't like the Invicta logo on the left side of the case. It's hardly noticeable and, I think, it gives the watch a unique look. I've read this watch can be easily modifiable and plan on doing just that when I get some downtime. Good luck!"
5,"Excellent Quality - Great Value These headphones are fantastic.  I don't typically like the fit of inner ear headphones, but need something to exercise with so I figured I would give these a shot b/c it had a unique fit in the ear.  I usually have trouble with inner ear headphones, they always fall out.  I was also skeptical about the quality considering I have a high end pair of noise cancelling headphones for travel.  I have to say that I am very impressed.  These are a great value.  They have a strong bass and can pack a punch.  The sound quality is excellent.  I was also blown away by the fit.  The way they shape the ear keeps them in place, they don't fall out, and they are much more comfortable then headphones that curve over the top of the ear.  I would rate these a 9/10.  Your really can't beat it for the price."
2,"Horrible Gas/Stomach Issues Alright, I'm going to be real even though it's TMI to the max, but I wish I had paid more attention to the few reviews that noted these issues as well (which makes me wonder how many of these good reviews could be fake). I took this product once in the morning and once at night with a full glass of water and a meal for almost the full bottle. Whether it actually works or not I can't say, but it doesn't matter because the accompanying stomach pain, discomfort, and gas was not worth it. I won't go into too much detail...I was never one to be gassy or have foul ones at that, but this definitely set the bar and only until I stopped taking these pills for a whole week did I return to normal. If you are willing to spend the $44 to see if it upsets you as well or actually works, go for it. There are some good reviews on here that are hopefully real, but I feel cheated for the side effects of a pill filled with shrooms and oregano and other people have noticed it too."
3,"It’s Not the Best Had this for two years now and the digital display is starting to go out line by line and the led lights were never bright enough. I’m giving it three stars because the fan does work well and the rangehood looks as shown in photos."
3,"Not well constructed inside. Refused to charge after a time. This product worked well and is a great idea. It worked wonderfully at first but later it gave out and refused to charge.  This product worked well with soft foods or protein powders. It is not like the nutrabullet or even as a blender. It does add air and mix so a nice cold foam is possible. It just did not last long enough for the cost.  I got one for half the price as  it's replacement from  hamilton beach and it works very well..This one plugs in so it doesn't charge. IF this product was sturdy it would be a cut above the rest. Maybe the next generation of personal blenders will be better."
1,"Wanted to old material back These are not the Danskins I have purchased in the past,.  The old ones that I have now have are more of a cotton,  I purchased the same size and have these in leggings and capris, now they are 5 or 6 years old but they are the best.  Since they are getting old, needed to update but now I don't know."
4,"The only thing that would have made it better is if there was a way to split off ... This was a solid value. The only thing that would have made it better is if there was a way to split off the front section so ""purse type"" stuff could come off of ""textbook and laptop"" stuff. and be a separate backpack. Or rollers... just having to cart the whole thing full of school stuff all day is a pain.  Edited to add: Now that the semester is over, I have to come back and say, this thing performed like a champ, after a LOT of abuse, winter weather, massive textbooks, being stuffed to the gills and such, it still shows NO signs of wear, nothing fell off it, nothing broke, the stitching all held, all of the buckles are in fine order, and not one zipper decided to stop zipping. It kept my stuff protected and dry in the rain, and the straps were actually padded in a functional way. I still had way too much stuff to pack into it, but that's my school's fault, not the backpack. This backpack was a GREAT deal. The only issue I really encountered was the ""phone pocket"" on the strap was not big enough for an actual phone. it is about right for a few pens maybe?  I should note, though, I never took my laptop in it, mainly because the classes I needed my laptop for, that was all I had to take, so I didn't need the other stuff in the backpack. Also I had so much heavy stuff to carry, I was not sure of the laptop not getting smooshed or banged into."
4,"Adorable earrings! These are such cute earrings! You may need to trim the tops of the bags to prevent the plastic from tickling behind your ears. :)"
4,"It helps with menopausal dryness This product does what it states. But I only used 1/2 at a time. One was too much. Too much leakage. But it definitely helped with menopausal dryness."
5,"Great Great"
5,"Loving This Watch Already! I came across this watch after muddling through hundreds of watches online, looking for just the perfect one for the clinical classes I'm about to start in nursing school this coming summer. I needed a watch that was comfortable, cheaply priced (I'm a broke college student), easily replaceable, with a secondhand and for personal tastes, one that looked simple and sweet. This watch has fit all of my expectations, plus it's comfortable. It's so light, and I can't even feel the band pulling or tugging or irritating my skin or anything like that so I'm pretty happy because I hadn't even thought of the comfort myself before previously buying it. Moving on, I saw a review on here that gave it a bad rating because they thought it was difficult to set the time, and honestly, I would say ignore that review! It's literally so easy to set the time, and it even has the manual telling you how in one sentence. But, basically all that you do is pull out the little silver crown on the side (which by the way don't be afraid to pull, I was hesitant to pull it to roughly at first also) until you hear or feel a little click, and then simply rotate it to the time you want, push the crown back in, and tada! All done. I was so fearful because of the one review I saw but I was surprised to see how it easy it was. Anyways as to durability, water resistance, and all that, I'm not sure yet because I've only had it for a an hour in a half but even if it's not that great, I don't think I'll be upset because the price tag is so low that I can tatter it up in clinical classes, and easily get a new one without feeling so down and out about the money being spent. But that being said, I do plan to check back in for you guys at the end of summer and let you know how It fairs after all the hand washing, and heavy use. I'd also like to mention that I'm a woman and that if you're thrown of by the title because it says ""Men's,"" don't be! This watch looks equally as good on women, it's not to big, it's in just the right spot to be what I consider unisex. I'd even lean on the side of saying that it's kind of small as many reviewers have mentioned. But I think that people with medium sized wrist can get away with it, I'm not 100% sure because I personally have small wrists. Adding to this, If it's of any help to anyone, I wear mine on the 7th hole as someone with small wrists, so I think that for people with medium wrists there's still plenty of room on the band. Overall, I think that if you're thinking of going for this watch you should! It's a great value for a simple and classyish-looking every day watch."
5,"Nice size I like the size of the boxes in the calendar and can’t wait to use it for next year."
5,"So many compliments! My fiance looses his watches pretty often, so doesn't want to spend a ton of money replacing them. He's also been watching a lot of Stranger Things, so this watch was totally #vibes. He has received SO MANY compliments on this watch! It doesn't look like it costs more than it does, but people seem to love the retro style, and it's very in line with his aesthetic. If you want a watch that looks expensive, this isn't for you, but if you want a watch that makes a statement, order this one. It's pretty small too, so I'm always surprised when people notice it, but it does get a lot of attention."
5,"Love these shirts! I love these shirts and currently own 3. I bought these for when I ride horses in the South during the summer and these shirts protect my skin from the sun and are no more hot than when I ride in a tank top. They're fast drying and a flattering fit. Absolutely love them!"
5,"Good product Smells great! The smell also isn’t too strong. Will purchase again."
5,"The cfm's are amazing. Even installed higher than standard it pulls very ... Very high quality hood. I was slightly concerned because the price was much lower than comparable hoods. The cfm's are amazing. Even installed higher than standard it pulls very well over our gas range. The only thing we don't care for is that the LED's are very blue. With them on, it is difficult to see the actual flame on the burner."
5,"Fabulous Wonderful wonderful wonderful...."
5,"It may last a lifetime! I owned a watch nearly identical to this one that Mom bought me for my birthday nearly 40 years ago. I still don't know how I lost it. I hope this one and I last another 40 years together."
5,"Five Stars easy to use, good strength ""fabric' wipe, not strong odor; non irritating /gentle"
5,"Extremely useful for beginners + affordable It took me four months to get from regular ear piercings to a size 0 and these worked extremely well. It only took so long because I had around three blowouts but for the most part, I used these and got what I wanted out of them and now I can go into a tattoo/piercing shop and buy real gauges with diamonds, gold, whatever is professionally available. I would recommend this to anyone who wants to stretch their ears but make sure to do accurate research on how long you should go before going up a size and listen to your ears, you shouldn’t be in pain for more than a day when you go up a size and you shouldn’t force your ears to constantly keep stretching in a short amount of time."
5,"Five Stars Highly recommended. Price is chipper than store."
5,"Super long These are great and super long!!"
5,"Elegant,luxorious and magical Watch 5 stars on first impression. I can't tell you how many people have complimented me on this watch. It's stunning to look at and looks even better in person's hand. Its built quality is above what I'd expect. I love my new Invicta Men's 20305. It looks amazing. The watch is big&amp; bulky which personally I like and is a little heavy but i love this. I love absolutely everything about this watch. The shipping was right on time as well. After buying this watch I am in love with Invicta watches and plan on recommending it to all my friends. Thank you amazon!"
2,"Not sized right. Not true to size didnt like the material, is more like a rain coat."
3,"Not enough of an X cut. We got these because our baby needed rice added to her formula. These specific X cut nipples still didn't allow the thicker rice formula combo to flow through. We ended up cutting our own nipples which worked much better. She is now 8 months old and still struggled to get the formula out when we tried these nipples as alternates again. Especially not good if your child is teething. The added pressure when they are struggling with these nipples may make them just give up on finishing the bottle like our little girl did. Not worth it in my book. Long story short, cut your own nipples and save your money on these. Or, buy these and increase the cut."
1,"Not worth the money! Did not help my hot flashes at all."
1,"Don’t waste your money I never write anything about products. I don’t recommend this one. I got a terrible rash..."
1,"Blad stem Breaks after using for a while I used it every once in a while and 8 months later went to use it and it’s broken.. the stem of the blade falls out as you use it.. dangerous and broken. Very disappointed.. never had a problem like this with other brands."
4,"I feel as though it doesn't hold as much as advertised and getting the nipples into the designated areas isn't very easy. Still This clutch is very convenient for when I need to wash my daughter's bottles. It certainly came in handy when I needed to wash everything before their initial use. I feel as though it doesn't hold as much as advertised and getting the nipples into the designated areas isn't very easy. Still happy with my purchase overall though"
4,"I love it it is a Christmas gift so I still have it. can't wait to see granddaughters face when she gets it. I love it"
4,"Great Bottle I like these bottles. They do leak for me a little from the collar only when mixing formula NOT while feeding. Which is fine by me these are so cheap for 12 bottles/collars/nipples. I've been using medela bottles for 6 months but a 3 pack is $15 and finding spare parts is nearly impossible. We needed a lot of bottles so we could keep some at daycare and at home and i didn't want to spend a fortune. These are great did the trick. They are slow flow nipples that come with it so i just poked another hole to make it more of a medium/fast flow for my 7 month old."
5,"9th year wedding anniversary Gave to my wife for our 9th year wedding anniversary. She really likes it even told her to put an flashlight in the crystal and it show her I love you in many different languages"
5,"As described Great"
5,"Amazing coffee Great flavor!! Cheaper than off nespresso website! Plus I love the color of the pods!!"
5,"She loves it Fit perfect"
5,"my parents were furious. thank god they're fake They're so realistic my parents actually believed they were real!! But they chewed me out quite a bit. I wonder how they'll feel about the nipple piercings...."
5,"This is simply a great watch. I can wear it whether I'm dressed ... This is simply a great watch. I can wear it whether I'm dressed up or down and it fits right in, and everywhere I go I have people compliment it. In fact, I think I've had more compliments on this watch that everything else I've worn combined. I've been wearing it constantly for several months now and even though I've bumped into countless things, there's not a single scuff or mark on the face of the watch. The only sign it's been worn at all is some very minor scuffing around the clasp from where I've set my hand down on stuff. Overall, I would recommend this watch to anyone."
5,"This watch is beautiful, very well made This watch is beautiful, very well made, has the looks and feel of a watch triple the price. I have 2 Seiko watches that are 30 years old and still work perfect."
5,"Very Pleasantly Surprised! I own a handful of true wireless earbuds ranging in price from $15 to $200, so I've seen and heard both sides of the spectrum and a lot in between.  What I've found, generally, is you get what you pay for in that $30 - $60 range - good but nothing to write home about, especially if you use them to listen to music.  With that said, I wasn't holding my breath on this pair due to it falling in that ""eh"" price range.  I ended up being very impressed with these and quality wise, they are more in line with the $100+ models than they are with anything in this price range.  The metal case they come in is a bit larger and heavier than some other wireless earbuds but it's for a good reason - it feels really well made and sturdy.  You don't have to treat them with kid gloves and I wouldn't think twice about just tossing them in a travel bag without protection other than the case.  The sound quality is, frankly, amazing for the price you pay.  I expected flat bass levels and tinny treble but the range is surprisingly deep and high.  The pads fit snugly in my ears but not to the point of aching, even after an hours worth of use.  The snug fit means better noise canceling and less sound loss.  It's not going to replace my studio headphones, but there isn't a pair of true wireless earbuds that can.  All things considered, this is one of the best values I've gotten in a long time and I can't recommend them enough."
5,"Would recommend Very nice and true to size. I ordered a medium. I'm 5'9 and 140 pounds. Will be ordering more colors"
5,"Just what i wanted! I been using for about a week now, I've been skating with it on, running, and daily school and its been comfortable the entire time.  Honeslty dont have anything bad to say about it. Has plenty of pockets for space and is perfect"
5,"Looking for studs these are a great buy They are very comfortable. I haven't taken them off since putting them in; even sleep with them in. The post is long enough and the “butterfly” back fits very securely. Hasn't gotten loose since I bought the a week ago. I did not know what size to buy so I bought this product because it gave me a choice without breaking the bank.  I am glad I made this purchase it was an excellent choice ."
5,"Great value, looks very sleek and modern, excellent customer service. Excellent customer service from this company. My unit was dented and I was missing a piece of the chimney.  They immediately sent me a brand new unit. I am very happy with it,my electrician installed it very quickly. It is a great value and the company stands by their product.  Would definitely recommend."
5,"Gift I bought this for my mom and it is a great size and looks really high dollar and works great."
2,"Wrong color found out that Cyan cartridge had Magenta color in it.  Other . two cartridges were fine."
3,"great watch but snags on dress shirts The watch has many features that I like; the color, its rugedness, its easy to read face (since I don't run with my reading glasses on this is a factor) and its easy to use menu.  The reason I sent it back was the watch's height manages to snag itself on every single men's dress shirt I own.  I got the regular sized one and am ok with it but wished there was a larger face on it."
3,"Good sticker books to byebye time with Like You can almost make perfect images without cracks if yiu are super sensitive about the gap between each puzzle pieces.  Dislike Images are less detailed than some other books i own"
1,"Disappointed with a defected backpack. I thought the backpack is supposed to have a straight back, but it seems like there’s a plastic piece that’s in the middle of back that is curved, and made the back of the bag curved. I don’t think this is normal, never seen a backpack with a curved back... very disappointed to get a defected backpack."
1,"GET COMOTOMO INSTEAD. I had originally wanted the NUK bottles for my son because I thought the nipple looked more natural than others but the slow flow is too fast. I didn’t realize this until I had switched to the comotomo bottles and noticed my son spitting up WAY less. He was able to drink at a good pace whereas with the NUK he was getting too much too quickly. Also NUK is made with Tritan plastic which still contains chemicals that can transfer into the milk... I highly recommend the comotomo bottles. They are a bit pricier but my son has had way less gas and less spit up since I made the switch."
4,"Lightweight keeps perfect time. Comfortable . watch looks great, the band looks cheap."
4,"Pretty, cheap peach earrings These are pretty.  They don't look quite as pretty as the picture, but they are great for the price.  I wish I could find marginally nicer, marginally more expensive ones.  The metal doesn't look quite like rose gold.  Looks more like copper-tinted aluminum.  The stone is a peachy sort of color, which is why I bought them.  If you have a peach skin tone, these would look good on you.  If you have a very pink skin tone, they are probably too yellow to look good on you."
5,"comes in a little bag all 5 are cute and durable"
5,"Always Always Use these if I need to feel safe"
5,"Great!!!!! Worked well for me"
5,"Have needed this forever Stronger than i thought!"
5,"Awesome Purchase I love this thing. I notice a big difference in the butter I’ve made on my own (stirring constantly) and the Magical Butter machine. Well worth the money. The only suggestion is to strain the contents through a mesh strainer before straining through the bag that’s provided."
5,"Awesome backpack, liked it. This is an awesome backpack. It has a secure pouch for a laptop. It is big storage bag, I can put all my stuff in. I putted my work and personal items. It's a good quality fabric and stitching is sturdy enough to hold up to rough daily use. I wasn't expecting this quality, I liked it. I like to use backpack. The weightis important for me, and I really don't notice the weight."
5,"Easy to use and comfortable Works perfect for my daughter during soccer season. Super comfortable and easy to get in and out. I like that it’s soft plastic/rubber versus a metal retainer."
5,"perfect replacement This kept my vitamix going for 10 years :)"
5,"Good gadget in fair price It is a great and worthy substitute for apple's airpod. Firstly, the price is really ideal for buying a wireless earphone with a good quality and looking. The charging case is very compact, and both of the case and earphone look very smart and stylis. When I opened the package, I fall in love with them. It is very light weight and easy to use. You only need to turn on the bluetooth on the phone find this gadget, then connect it easily. The quality of sound is excellent too and is better than I expect. Therefore, I sometimes to use it to listen the music rather than just use the phone. If you like buy a fair price gadget with great quality, I will recommend this!"
5,"Cute functional portable personal blender Cute portable blender! Very easy to use and just need to charge like any other product out there right and and you’re good to go! Size could be bigger and blending power could be a little stronger but I guess these are limited due to accommodating to portability."
5,"Love Use this for work and it fits all my needs. Easy on the back too. Love its durability (so far)"
5,"Best Backpack I've Ever Had Awesome backpack. I used to only spend $20-30 on my backpacks but this was worth the extra cash. It keeps my laptop and books dry in the rain. Also, it is a huge backpack. I can basically fit anything I need to. I love this backpack for its looks, size, and adaptability. 10/10."
5,"Would recommend the other people It's always hard to buy jewelry online. Typically does not come in the way you want or look the way it truly is. I highly recommend this. Perfect size perfect length for nice size pendant."
2,"Doesn't stay together and gets metal dust in your coffee Grinds coffee well and looks nice, but doesn't have clicks/settings like I thought it would and it took a few tries to get it right. I also noticed that the top edge of the lid rubs against the handle as it it turning and creates a very fine metal dust that makes its way into the chamber, and thus, the coffee.  But my biggest complaint is that the three stainless pieces (the main grinding portion, the bottom reservoir, and the lid) don't stay together at all, so you have to hold the lid without the handle swinging and knocking your fingers while you grind, while pressing against a table or other surface. If you want to walk around and grind with this, you need to be able to hold both the lid and the bottom piece to the main grinding body, which requires large, strong hands. I have big hands, but my hands usually get cramped from holding this together every day and I usually also have to hold it against my stomach or leg as well. After 4 months with this, I can't deal with it anymore, so I'm getting a new one. I'm surprised I haven't seen more people mention this issue."
3,"Big and Small at the same time? It fits... weird. I'm 5'7"" 130lbs and I have a large bust and long arms, and past M sized compression shirts are too short, so I went with the large. The large feels baggy, and the turtleneck doesn't even hug my neck, just kinda sticks out. And then the sleeves are still way too short! At least it's warm and good for running, but I wanted to wear this under t-shirts for going to work, but it just looks silly."
1,"Looks dull in person - not as bright and popping as ... Looks dull in person - not as bright and popping as in photo - would not have bought it in person."
1,"Horrible chemical smell, do not buy! I was so excited to get these as an addon for so cheap,  but when I received I was disappointed after opening the box and smelling a horrendous chemical odor. I washed one with warm soap and water and it still smelled, I had to wash it 2 times to get the smell almost all the way off. I do not think this is safe for a baby or sterilized as it says, the packs weren't even wrapped they were loose in the box. I will stick to buying these at my local store so i can be sure they're the real deal and actually sterilized."
4,"Good fit, nice pattern and colors The colors are brilliant and the pattern is nice. I get lots if compliments on this dress. I don’t like the material quite s much as dressesI have bought previously on Amazon . It wrinkles very slightly where the others could be wadded up and never wrinkle. This is why I didn’t give five stars."
4,"Nice mounting and studs. Photos misleading of color The mounting, threaded studs, and backs are all of great quality. I was a bit disappointed in color of the diamonds, however. The photos in the listing are clearly not of the same color grade as what is being sold there. It is written in the description, but a picture speaks a thousand words and it would be far easier for a first-time diamond buyer like myself to know what they're getting into if the photos more accurately represented the product. My wife likes them a lot, and given her deep olive complexion and dark hair there is sufficient contrast for the diamonds to look quite nice on her. This seller is not really doing their part to ensure confidence for those buying jewelry sight unseen, however, and for that reason I held a star back. I will hopefully remember to take a photo at some point to add to this review, for the benefit of others, so that they can see what these stones REALLY look like."
4,"Four Stars Missing one brush from the small bottles"
5,"A Really Great Watch This is one of the best watches I have ever owned, if not the best.  While I bought it originally only to use while boating and fishing, I now wear it as my everyday watch.  Yes, it is a bit bulky, but not bad and the wristband is really comfortable in part to some unique built in transition flanges on the inside edges of where the wristband connects to the watch.  This review is several months after having used the Pathfinder daily.  Both mechanically, as well as cosmetically, this Casio has performed and held up extremely well.  In addition to the useful marine functions, I find this watch to have some really useful features for aviators too.  The solar charging and atomic time keeping are great and when you remove the watch at the end of the day it eventually shuts off the display to conserve energy.  Soon as you pick it up the display comes on and stays on while wearing it.  This is a really great watch and worth every penny."

Once received, make a cup of juice immediately, very delicate, I feel that it can be used several times with a single charge. Love it!"
5,"Get slinging! I really like this for going to gym or grocery store."
5,"Easy to use and clean for sure. Easy to use and clean for sure. It is designed for a variety of uses. The hand feels good because of the materials."
5,"Fit great and very warm and comfortable Fit great and very warm and comfortable.  Wore it as a base layer under a fleece on a snowshoe adventure in mid-30 degree sunny day.  There were times I got hot.  Would buy this again."
5,"These are lovely earrings! These are an excellent addition to anyone's collections of sweet pearls. They are just lovely and can be used for everyday wear. I recommend them highly. They are also packaged in a wonderful box and would make a great gift as well. Excellent purchase!"
5,"Love it! Perfect!"
5,"Very pleasantly surprised. Initially, I was hesitant to buy a G-Shock. I have about a dozen other watches including several ""high-end"" Swiss mechanical watches that cost thousands, so it's not like I *needed* another watch. However, I liked the idea of having a watch that I wouldn't have to worry about on my more adventurous, outdoorsy outings and vacations. I especially wanted a watch where I could easily change the timezone but still keep an eye on my home city time since I travel a lot (I have a Swiss-made mechanical world timer, but it's a pain to adjust because it doesn't automatically adjust for DST or the International Dateline). The GravityMaster series was an obvious candidate versus the MudMaster, but I liked the looks of the MudMaster better. Finally, I was worried that once I got it, I wouldn't wear it and I'd fall back to my other watches. I thought it would be too big, too garish, and too plastic-y.  As soon as I got it and put it on, I knew I made the right choice. I have a 7-7.25"" wrist and broad forearms, so the large size of the watch looked good and better yet it fit nicely and wasn't heavy at all. The watch is thick so long sleeves are difficult unless the cuff is fairly loose. Also, I'm glad I opted for the green strap version versus the one in black. I think the black strap would have been too severe. Overall, it's a nicely rugged, masculine look.  For once, I actually read the manual and it didn't take long for me to learn 80% of the functionality. I was pleasantly surprised at how easy it is to set the timezone as well. It's very intuitive after you do it once and you don't have to fuss with making sure the day/date is correct as you cross the International Dateline. The only annoyance is that when the timezone is set to Tokyo time, all the measurements switch to Metric from Imperial even if you had set it otherwise (i.e. meters vs. feet, Celsius vs Fahrenheit).  I had fun with the ABC (altimeter, barometer and compass) functions, but use the altimeter with a grain of salt as it's only as accurate as the last time you calibrate it. The temperature basically reads the heat coming off your wrist since the sensor is right there. If you take the watch off, it'll adjust to ambient temperature, but takes a while. The LED light was handy in the dark airplane cabin and when all the lights unexpectedly turned off in my hotel room and it was pitch black.  Otherwise, the buttons are easy to push, the whole watch feels solid, the sapphire crystal is as clear as my best watches, and it is comfortable to wear. I didn't worry about getting mugged, bumping into doors or trees or rocks, getting it wet or covered in sunscreen, and making sure the watch was wound or battery replaced when I wore it on my recent trip to Bali.  Obviously, I'm really happy with it and I'm already looking forward to wearing it on my upcoming whitewater rafting trip and picking up one or two other G-Shocks to add to my collection."
5,"Very easy to use This multi-functional juicer with 6 blades,quickly juiced, only 30 seconds, you can drink a cup of fresh nutritious juice. the USB juicer cup comes equipped with a built-in 2200mAh rechargeable battery that can be easily charged by Power bank, laptop, computer, mobile phones or other USB devices. Very easy to use."
5,"Love the fit! I’m a size 16/18, very large bust, and very curvy. I ordered an XL in the off-shoulder style.  This dress fit exactly how I was needing it to you!  I was half expecting it to fit too snug in the hips, but it is perfect! The material is almost swimsuit like, which will be perfect for traveling/packing."
5,"got it got package no problems"
5,"Great quality and holding up so far... This is one of those products where straight out of the packaging you know you've made a solid choice.  Loads of neat compartments and great capacity. I bought the 36L version to be able to carry two laptops (a 13"" MBP and a 15"" Asus PC), together with a stack of associated cables &amp; connectors. It's been crammed full and carried in anger - all without breaking a strap or zip.  I don't intend to have it so heavily packed all the time, but it was reassuring to know that it didn't fail when the going got tough. Great product - if you're toying with getting one, just pull the trigger!"
5,"Not just for make up! I LOVED the strong quality of this item. I loved it so much that I ordered a second set to organize my jewelry and both sets fit perfectly in my drawer. It looks absolutely organized. I can see each piece immediately and access them faster as opposed to before when I had to go over each of them when they were all piled up together. Sometimes I did not even want to waste my time in figuring out which piece of jewelry was where and find the one to wear. I even preferred not wearing the best ones for my outfit since I was rushing out the door. Although these organizers are labeled to be for make up they ended up being jewelry organizers for me &amp; I am extremely happy that they worked for this interest."
2,"Not worth it They made me break out, bend super easily &amp; made me itch, usually I do not have a problem with sterling silver"
3,"Passably adequate - 3 months of ownership Cheap, not terrible. Passably adequate.  I've owned this microwave for a few months now.  It works and it's cheap. But it seems underpowered for the claimed level, and there are corners cut. There were cosmetic defects on the inside of the unit and the button covering is a very cheap film that easily separates from its backing."
3,"Decent purchase for price! Positives first: really affordable and really easy to set up and connect. Negative: Noticed the skipping immediately; it is really annoying but not so annoying that I'm willing to go through the hassle of returning them. I've had them about a month and the skipping hasn't stopped, again, it isn't awful just annoying. I use them at work so I don't test out how loud they really get regularly but they do get loud to the point where I can't hear the highway traffic outside or the people talking outside of my door. I don't run in them so I can't attest to their moisture wicking properties or ability to stay in the ear. They are comfortable in comparison to my BOSE over-the-ear headphones (not all that comparable considering the difference in styles). Overall, a decent purchase."
1,"NO CLIPS Clips do not come with it. I tried to order some a they dont fit. Complete waste of money!"
1,"Mr. Coffee warmer (beware) I bought mine 6 months ago. It was the best purchase I'd ever made until one night I could not sleep and as I sat on the sofa beside my warmer I smelled an electrical smell. I searched everywhere until I saw smoke coming from the warmer. I immediately unplugged it. I waited for it to cool then disassembled it to see what had happened. It had completely melted the soldered joints on the electrical board inside and they shorted against each other. I was so relieved I couldn't sleep or my house and myself would no longer be here. This was terribly frightening!"
4,"Good purchase I bought a size XL and 2xl in white. The hoodie itself is great! I bought these to tie-dye. The fabric is soft. I normally wear an xl in a T-shirt sometimes 2xl, the xl in this hoodie was tight around my hips. Pant size 14-16 in woman’s. The 2xl fit perfectly around the hips and elsewhere except the sleeves were slightly too long, but no problem I can roll them up. They are light weight and I can’t wait to dye them. Have not washed them yet so I do not know how they will hold up."
4,"Too big, BUT cozy! I just received my order today! A few things: 1. It IS too big, I followed the measurements, but guess I overestimated or it’s due to the weight I’ve lost. I ordered a large, but could easily have fit in a medium. But I still like it, perfect cozy sweater to wear around the house, will pair it with chunky socks. 2. The color is supposed to be “purple” but is more a magenta pink.  I included a photo of the fit. For reference, I am 5’3” and usually wear a 14W and usually get a size XL in leggings.  Overall, I am happy with the purchase and will order another one in another color and size down."
5,"Cheaper alternative, great quality I've been using the SteelSeries QcK mousepad for years and they always got dirty from dead skin and the cloth would be torn making it inaccurate when playing fps (unnoticeable otherwise). These are thicker and cheaper and have held up.  I will update if it shows any signs of similar problems."
5,"Exactly what I was looking for Thank you much for these beautiful rings. The colors and slight glitter are beautiful. The rings are comfortable and feel like they will last. I am VERY IMPRESSED with the customer service! I received an email before my rings arrived explaining that the company wanted to be sure that I was satisfied with the fit and look of the rings.  When my rings arrived they fit a little snug and I was worried that it might not be comfortable to wear for very long. I replied to their email and they sent me the next size up even without needing to receive the rings back! I was promptly sent a new set of rings! I have already shared the product link with 2 friends who mentioned they wanted silicon bands for exercise! I highly recommend these rings! No need to buy those expensive name brands! This is where it is at!"
5,"Amazing watch Stunning watch, great gold plated and size. Super elegant"
5,"Best Bowl Cleaner I've been looking for this type of product for quite a while. Bought 3 of the swabs - one for each bathroom.  The head is soft so it will fit under the rim to reach the spots you can't see. No more water flinging up at me while pushing hard bristles into that hard to reach space - YUCK! The only downside is I can't wring or tap out the water as thoroughly as I would like so I usually trap the brush between the rim and seat to drip dry before storing."
5,"All Spectacular, He love it!, just in time."
5,"practical as well as stylish I use this back pack for commuting to work each day. Seems to hold all I need including my walking shoes. It is stylish as well was functional with the extra capacity zip option for when needed. Also great is the handle on the side that turns it into a carry bag, when you do not want a back pack look (like going into a court room). Seller is very helpful and pleasure to deal with . On my experience I would say 'not too heavy rain , like shower proof'. Device charging feature allows you to keep the charger secure in bag. Yeah, good bag!!"
5,"Great cooktop We have received the Gasland Glass cooktop, after installed, which was very easy installation, we started to used right away.  The cooktop is easy to learn the settings in order to cook, the Lock"" selection/choice is a very excellent to prevent any incident with kids and/or pets, also while cleaning the top.  Cooks very fast, selection  of heat easy to change, once you get familiar with the way to change your desired heat. One thing that is not great is the cleaning of the top. I have been tried three different solutions in the cleaning of the top. No matter which one I used the top of the cooktop is never shine, always fade.  Other than that, the cooktop is been a great decision to purchased to replace the one I had.  Regards,  AH"
5,"Good quality - even better price! These earrings were perfect.  They look exactly like the photo, are well-made and light as a feather.  The earrings are stiffer than regular leather (not as flexible), but they're not supposed to be real leather so it's a non-issue.  LOVE."

He likes that it’s very large and u can put a lot off staff , and a lot of pockets.  Very comfortable for traveling, u can put your laptop and charge your phone."
5,"I bought this one for my grandmother, I have ... I bought this one for my grandmother, I have had the same over for over a year, still looks new and I use it almost every day, just the right height and its big enough to fit over a large plate"
5,"Five Stars it is nice size..i put it on the counter....."
5,"My favorite leggings! I love these leggings. They’re so comfortable and stretchy. They are slightly on the thin side so we’ll see how they are this winter. I wore them in the summer and they were great! They’re high waisted and don’t move at all. I just bought my second pair."
5,"Will definitely buy again! This is probably the best most inexpensive earphones I have ever had in my freaking life! I have rescue cats and one of them got into my room and ate my old buds. Instead of buying the same earbuds that cost over $30 I decided to go with this pair, I figured I could get an inexpensive pair and just buy the kind I had before at a later time. Well that's not going to happen because these are amazing. Usually when you buy earbuds at a low price they suck and the quality is garbage, but these are fantastic."
2,"Poor quality The pedant looks good but the quality is very poor. I ordered one and it came with one of the stones missing. I returned it and ordered another one, it came fine, but within 2-3 days the stones started to pop out one by one. Like I said, the pedant looks very cute, but it's a shame that it falls apart right away."
3,"Three Stars My wife loves it👍👍👍"
1,"are terrible. There is constant feed back and static noise ... This is the 2nd pair of beats3 I get from this vendor.  The first the battery just died and stopped charging.  This replacement pair I was sent after speaking to an Amazon rep. are terrible.  There is constant feed back and static  noise coming out of the right ear bud.  If I talk on the phone with them all the person talking to me hears is static noise and they compare it to a fax machine.  Extremely disappointed!!!"
1,"Buyer beware Received product in what looked like a previously opened box. Installed and product defective with error codes- sent it back for refund"
4,"Works well I have to change bandages on my leg a couple times a day I have had scissors that would not necessarily cut through the bandage material so easy and were big and Godey these are just the right size and perfect they feel great and can be rinsed without worrying about them. What an excellent pair of scissors."
4,"Chefman Immersion Blender I go through weeks where I live on smoothies. I have a Vitamix which works really well for smoothies, but honestly, I’m lazy and like something I can pop in the dishwasher. So I like that the blade is dishwasher safe, thus making my cleanup much easier.  For a basic immersion blender, this Chefman one works well. I’m no pro or even an amateur in the kitchen, but it serves my need for well-blended smoothies. The cord isn’t too short either, which is good."
4,"OK. (There are much better tasting Peet's coffee's) Come on Amazon, give us more selections of Peet's!). I really wish Amazon would sell Peet's holiday blend. This is an ok standby. Just a tad bitter. To us, we think the Starbucks dark roast is better tasting. Peet's has some really great coffee's so not sure why Amazon is pushing this particular coffee. We still order this via our DASH BUTTON just to have some on hand for when we run out of Starbucks."
5,"Comfortable Cute style and always love brooks such comfortable shoes"
5,"Holy Smokes Absolutely stunning in person...just gorgeous"
5,"Good Scrubber Working great, I like to keep several of these handy to make sure straws can be scrubbed on the inside."
5,"The perfect short Very comfortable. Great for lounging, running errands, or working out. For me, these are the perfect mix of the function of Nike running shorts and the softness of Soffe cheer shorts. Plus they have pockets!"
5,"Style and durability After a full year of use. And wearing it daily , it time for a review. I assure you you will get your money's worth. As a local truck driver this watch took a beating. Ive dropped, kicked it, tossed it, washed it and even dried it in a dryer. All by accident (don't ask me how) bit it's still ticking and has not missed a beat. I get compliment all the time, people think it's an expensive watch. If you are looking for something stylish and durable this is an excellent choice."
5,"Awesome Bold Coffee! Love Peet's coffee.  Buying on line through Amazon Prime allows me to save a little money.  This is one of the higher priced K-Cups but I love a bold cup of coffee and Pete's fills the bill.  I LOVE this coffee and highly recommend it."
5,"Buy these now These are amazing  and ridiculously affordable.  Buy these now!"
5,"Excellent sound and earbud battery life! These are great earbuds! The battery life of the earbuds themselves really is incredible, 6-7hours! Double the length of other buds I have. Sound is still great and quite bassy. Solid connection even at range - they don't cut out nearly as much as my others. With the stems that hang out of the ears, the microphone can pick up my voice better than the purely in ear buds I have, I haven't used these extensively for phone calls yet though.  They are earbuds, so they are definitely sound isolating, but if these are noise cancelling I can't tell, I don't get that weird ear suction feeling like with Bose or other  noise cancellation. Pairing is mostly smooth, and resetting is easy - just turn them off then hold the button until they turn back on and make another beeping sound.  One thing that threw me off was that these activate and start pairing as soon as the charging case lid is opened. My old ones activate when they are removed from the case. Similarly, they stay active until the case is closed, not just until being put back in to charge. No big deal, just different.  Overall, they're great!"
5,"Works for me Bought a whole size larger. Good shoes. I use them to teach 8.5 hours of Tap per week.  After 1 year they are getting weird sounds when I walk. I will have to take them apart to see the issue."
5,"The most comfortable bra I have ever worn I received my Brabic bra in a beautiful zip lock bag with all the washing and drying instructions on the front, which I appreciate, as I always forget these details. I chose to order my bra size though I had read Brabic runs small. In my case the size was just right. I love love love the stap adjustments which are in the front along with the closure! I was able to do my adjustments with the bra on!!! I was originally looking for a bra that zips for easy dressing after my upcoming shoulder surgury. Then I read a bunch of reviews about the zippers coming undone at inopportune times. That made Brabics hook closure sound much safer!!!  There are  six hooks across the front of the bra distributing the pull of each side and adding to the support of the bra. The bra itself is made of light material with extra support around the breasts. There is a wide elastic band that runs around the bottom of the bra which makes me feel safe that even with activity, everything is going to stay where it belongs. The shoulder straps are wide and evenly distributed the weight of my bust. In the past I have had bra-straps dig into my shoulder. These feel light and comfortable and I think I will be wearing this bra the day of my surgury with no problems. Overall I am thrilled with this purchase!!! I would buy (and will be buying) Brabic again. I am going to love this Bra even after my shoulder is healed!!!"
5,"Perfect Gift Exactly what we wanted fast service."
5,"This is a beautiful watch that requires only one solar charge every 6 ... This is a beautiful watch that requires only one solar charge every 6 months.  Setup is somewhat complicated but not near as complicated as Citizen watches that I own.  The only problem I have with it is daylight savings time.  You have to FUDGE what time zone you are in during DST.  The watch will only give you your local time zone all year round.  Not a real big deal.  Seiko means quality IMHO.  But this with no worries. Well worth the money."

One combination that is easy to use and reset. 2. Spacious interior. 3. Outside door helps protect unit. 4. Shackle does not require use of second combination. 5. Seems very well built and strong.  I have this around one of the guide rails for my Jeep seat. I placed it under the seat where bolt cutters would not reach nor work easily. I have three keys that are one the larger side, two $20 bills and one $5 and three $1 bills. I rolled the bills very tightly and marked them so I could recognize each denomination. I had to manipulate the keys a few times to get all to fit, but I could get more in there if needed. Not much, maybe another bill or key.  Cannot find any negatives. Overall, at this time, five stars.  I have one pic at the top that shows the inside shackle lever."
5,"Nice socks Very cool and comfy!  Breathable."
2,"Run very small These run really, really small, just too lazy to ship back. very hard to get over head especially with one bad shoulder and one replaced shoulder."
3,"Needs to be softer I like these overall- they fit well but I do wish they were made with a silicone wrapping on them- I think my baby doesn’t like the “hardness” of the plastic and prefers to touch the bottle itself because it’s soft and squishy."
1,"Ball is hard to put on. I hate these! The ball is hard to put on. The hole is too small. I didnt like them. I Wish I would have returned them."

No way to take it apart and fix it either as the internals there are glued together not screwed like previous models. have videos and pictures.way to expensive to not get a year out of it, bought Sept 2017-today Mar 2018. Perhaps a more robust reliability test protocol next time before using new materials, my parents machine did the exact thing 2 weeks ago as well not even year either."
4,"Nice for the Money but I like the G Shock Series Better Everyone seems to like this watch and for the price, I should too, and for the most part I do! The band bugs me and the face data layout bugs me too. Usually, a digital watch display starts out with an 3-letter abbreviation for the day of the week followed by the numeric month and date separated by a dash. The display on this watch relegates the month and date to the lower right corner of the watch. Also there is an awkward space in that part of the displayed information. I get distracted when trying to glance at this watch for the date and realizing it isn't where it has always been (on other watches) and instead is down in the corner and doesn't look exactly right. True, I went by all the glowing reviews and chose this one to get my mind off the Apple Watch (What a departure!) but I would have been better served by one of the G Shock series watches from Casio instead for two reasons: A better designed display (more traditional) and a slightly wider and sturdier band."
4,"Great watch, terrible band This is a beautiful watch!  I love it. But when I strapped it on my wrist I could not wear it. The strap that came with it is garbage.  It is a hard imitation leather that does not bend to the wrist. It’s stiffness strangles the wrist in a death grip.  Such a gorgeous timepiece deserves a flexible actual leather strap that hugs the wrist like a soft caress.  I cannot wear it until I find a band that does the watch justice as well as fits properly."
4,"Cooler, somewhat drier It is cooler. It does wick moisture. It doesn’t mean you don’t feel sweaty, it just means the wet can dry more easily. But if you’re in a humid environment, well you just stay damp no matter what. It just doesn’t stay next to your skin as much and doesn’t feel as heavy as damp cotton. The fit is a little smaller for the same size compared to the regular women’s cotton shirts. Fabric is thin, you’ll want a t-Shirt bra underneath. I wish there were more colors."
5,"Great! Wish I knew about these bottles with my first! Easy to clean, great quality, helps colic, and the nipples were very close to mimicking the Breast."
5,"Great for exercise. Great for exercise. These stay in my ears while spinning. I have purchased other wireless ear buds that will not staying in, these work great and stay put."
5,"Wish I'd found these sooner Bought these with the avent standard breast pump conversion kit so I was able to pump directly into my bottles and not have more pump bottles to clean every day.  I think I'd be pumping for 6 months before I found these, and I wished I'd found them sooner!  These are also just great for portability to make sure your bottles don't spill.  Highly recommend getting these if you use Avent bottles."

5,"Dance Socks are the best of the 3 types I tried. Dance Socks are the best of the 3 types I tried.  1. ""Dance Socks"" worked best, were easy to slip on and off and were by far the best value. I got mine on Amazon because they ship fast (http://www.amazon.com/THE-DANCESOCKS.../dp/B00FHB4LIE), but next time I'll try the maker's website (http://www.thedancesocks.com/) directly. Note: u get TWO pair for $10, not one like the other brands. S&amp;H was $3.99 flat rate and took 4 days to get here. I ordered 3 sets and S&amp;H were still only $3.99 total. Why 3 sets? Because I'm a freak that looses stuff that is smaller than my house.  2. ""Zumba Carpet Gliders"" were the most expensive and were hard to get on and off. They cost $14.95 for 1 pair, plus $6.50 shipping and handling. It took 10 looooonnnggg days to arrive. The Zumba Carpet Gliders I tried worked pretty well on my big feet but are hard to get on and off. A classmate tried these and told me for her small feet that the ""one size fits all"" were too big and slipped off.  3. ""Smoother Dancers"" were the first type I tried. They cost $13.50 plus $3.32 S&amp;H. They were cheaper than the Zumba version but more that twice the cost of Dance Socks. In my opinion, they are easier to get on than the Zumba product but don't work as well Zumba. Dance Socks were easiest to get on and worked the best in my experience."
5,"Love, love Love, love, love!!!! Super easy, and so convenient. I make protein shakes in the morning, I just blend and go! Comes with a to go top so I can just take the whole container with me!!"
5,"So far so good Been using for a couple weeks now and so far so good. There is a LOT of space between the various compartments. Could work as my only bag for a short weekend trip. 13” mackbook fits no problem. This backpack is definitely bigger than your standard school backpack like a jansport or something comparable. Time will tell if the zippers hold up. They seem sturdy."
5,"Big difference in overall well being I want to weigh in with my review of this product because I read every single review before I took the plunge. I was wary, as many reviewers mentioned terrible headaches, and a number of those reviewers stopped taking it because of that. At the same time, I was pretty desperate for relief from unexplained depression and major anxiety (my life's pretty good), weight gain (doing nothing all that different) and major irritability (I'm normally easy going). I hit 50 and it was as if someone threw a switch and each of these symptoms started to creep in and got bad enough that it was impacting my life in a very negative way and causing me a lot of stress on top of the symptoms. On and off almost every day I would well up with tears and cry over basically nothing - I'd blame it on this or that, but really there was nothing to be sad about. I was touchy and short with my family and my clothes were becoming tighter - I'd look in the mirror and see a bulge, muffin top, whatever, forming around my waist. Never had that before. I was becoming more miserable as this went on, and suspecting it was at least partially hormone-related, I started researching and read about DIM, found this product, read each and every review and decided to go for it.  The headaches are not a joke. Maybe some don't get them, but I sure did. The first day or so weren't bad at all, but on the morning of the third day, I woke up with a very bad migraine that stayed with me for over 24 hours. I couldn't get out of bed, was sick/vomiting, and seriously fatigued. I started to second guess whether I should be taking this supplement but I remembered some of the reviewers saying - JUST STICK WITH IT!! And so I pushed through. On days 4-6 I got slight migraines at night and still didn't feel too great during the day. But by the end of the first week, things were changing.  By day 8, I felt more balanced than I had in months. I had energy, an even mood and just felt calm. This continued to the point that now, three weeks in, I feel so much better, almost a 180 degree turnaround. I don't feel depressed, my anxiety is way way less than it was all summer long, I'm more upbeat and productive, like my old self again. The weight seems to be gradually coming down, but I don't weigh myself so I can't say how many actual pounds but my clothes are starting to fit better and that's alright with me.  I highly recommend this to anyone who suspects their hormones are out of balance. Take it in the morning with a full glass of water and a little food. Push through the first week... don't give up. You might even prepare to call in a couple sick days if necessary and warn your family that you might be a little out of it for a week and get their support. If your experience is like mine, you'll start to feel better - a lot better - by the end of the first week. It's totally worth it. 100% worth it."
5,"Very useful Good product. I use it everyday. Worth the money."
5,"Pleased Love love love...i make smoothies almost every day. It handles ice, frozen fruit with ease. To clean I put a few cups if water init turn on a bit and mist comes out. Then I do a fast wash. It fits under my cabinets with like an inch to spare. Best thing I bought myself in long time."
5,"beautiful set love it! pretty good quality for the price, pendant AND chain. Nice keepsake, and precious way to remember a loved one, still with us, or not."
5,"Super cute and comfy! This skirt fit as expected and looks just like the picture. It's super cute, and comfortable to move around in. (I ordered XS since I wear size 2 bottoms, white color)."
2,"May be good for some applications, but not mine. I have a pair of nylon North Face shorts that are THE perfect pair of shorts. I wear then nearly daily around the house.  But recently I was stepping up on to a low wall and the stuff in my pocket caused the material to split. I was heartbroken. I would have bought 5 more pair just to have spares, but had found that, of course, North Face didn't offer them anymore, at least not the exact model. I tried to think of how I could repair them, but not having a sewing machine and with zero idea how to mend them even if I did, I searched around here and found this tape, which seemed to be just the answer. I could apply it on the inside of the rip and I'd be good to go. But once I carefully applied a strip that well covered the rip making sure to follow directions and round the corners, apply from center out, etc. after only a relatively short time, the rip pulled apart again. The tape simply didn't hold it together.  So I then applied the same thing on the outside,which doesn't look great, but hey.... one layer didn't work. This too pulled the rip apart slightly,  making it necessary to reapply the outer layer. With further wear the edges would come away from the material in various places making it necessary to trim these off. It's now conformed to the wrinkles in the shorts and seems to be stable. I haven't washed them yet,but am hoping the tape will survive. So this tape would likely work well for flat applications such as tents or sleeping bags, but for situations such as mine where the area is being bent and under a little stress, it's not that great."
3,"Nice small, quiet microwave I bought this microwave because I live with roommates and I wanted a small microwave that didn't have those LOUD beeping noises. This one is nice and quiet, no buttons, and when the food is ready it just has one DING of a bell that's not too loud. It's not very strong even on the high setting, so you will have to heat up your food a bit longer than you might be used to. For example it took me about 5-6 minutes to cook frozen veggies. But for the price and what I needed it for, it works alright."
3,"Not too bad I doubt the metal is completely stainless steel because they do cause my ears irritation, where as my stainless steel piercing studs dont. Otherwise the studs are beautiful and fit well. The size range is great, especially if you have multiple piercings"
1,"Have not had a good experience with these pads Have not had a good experience with these pads. They do no absorb much and the wings become unstuck. Very messy.  Will not buy these again."
1,"Don't buy it I was very disappointed in this product. I bought it for my granddaughter for Christmas last year. It got misplaced and was just recently found in the back of her closet. With excitement we assembled it and tried using(following the directions) it. After 2 hours the only thing we could see was a squiggly line, no matter what slide we have in. My husband, myself, my son and my brother in law tried getting it took work. My grand daughter is/was very disappointed. Just a warning Very Poor Quality"
4,"True to size I'm a 38G, so it's hard to find bras that fit.  I ordered one in my size and it fit so well, I ordered another one.  I ordered my true size - didn't have to size up or down.  4 stars for comfort and support.  The only thing I don't like about them is that sometimes you can see the lines on the bra through your shirt, but that's minor.  I'd still buy another one because they fit and they're reasonably priced."
4,"Great for washing pump equipment! I know these brushes are designed for Dr. Brown's bottles, but they work great for my pumping supplies. I bought these to wash the small crevices of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Medela-Personal-Fit-Breastsheild-Connectors-Medela-87071/dp/B000A88JZA/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Medela Personal Fit Breastsheild Connectors - Medela 87071</a>. This cleaning brush is just the right size to fit into the small openings of the connectors. I give it 4 instead of 5 stars because there is a small metal loop at the top that can get caught and stuck sometimes when I'm washing the crevices. In addition, the bristles are a little soft so the bristles at the tip get deformed after used only about a dozen times."
5,"Good coffee. Costs more than others. I bought this on black Friday deals because it made it cost the same as what I usually buy. Coffee tastes great. I will not be getting any more at the regular price because it is 30 to 40 percent more."
5,"Great Quality!!! Great Quality!!!"
5,"Dainty beautiful sturdy !! I am really really hard on all my stuff.  This sweet little ring survives and keeps on sparkling.  Brings me a little joy each time I look at it.  Really just amazing.  Beautiful packaging as well."
5,"Perfect size for a stud My ears are very sensitive... these earrings did not make me ears have a reaction. Perfect size for a stud."
5,"Can't Beat It! Good price. Good notebooks. Will order multiple packs at the beginning of the school year to get through."
5,"Book bag Great buy"
5,"Good quality, needed for dance My daughter wears a 9 women's, and size large is perfect. Starts out a bit smog, but stretches out a bit after wearing (or you can stick a Coke can in it to help stretch out)."
5,"Five Stars Very nice and attractive. Found similar to the picture. I like this classic model"
5,"Great value Nice easy read books great for beginners my daughter reads them hopefully this will get her into loving to read. I think so."
5,"Soft and comfy I bought this for my niece who turned 15.  She liked the color!  It happens to match her glasses!  (I didn't know at the time I ordered.)  I really liked that this was a crew neck and not v-neck top.  My niece is very modest and it was hard to find one like this.  I didn't see the shirt on her, but she did say that it fit just fine.  She now has some more to go with her skirts."
5,"Love this spinner backpack! I bought this because I wanted a spinner, not just a wheeled backpack. It is pretty perfect. The laptop compartment in the back takes my 15 inch laptop easily. I love this compartment - so handy. I've never had it tip over. Not sure why people are having this issue. I stuffed it full and no problem. I did have a laptop in it during my use of it. Maybe they are putting something very heavy on the top or front.  People are complaining it gets too fat - well of course it will if you stuff it crazy full. Mine fit under the seat and in the overhead easily. The water bottle pockets could be a little bigger but it will hold a 16 oz bottle. I would recommend this bag."
5,"Prime is the way to go! Beautiful watch a wear most days."
5,"Product This backpack has everything. It has a wide strip on the back to hang the backpack on your suitcase. It has card slots to put your credit cards in. It has a place for computer. It sits up. It is roomy. Love it!!!!"
2,"Ink tends to skip I do not know if it is because the pens are erasable, but the color is not very prominent.  I use these for color coding in my planner, but the color tends to be inconsistent and ""skip"" when writing an entry.  I like that they do erase easily, but the ink color is not very vibrant.  I won't be buying these again."
3,"Inside material terrible. The outside is as expected. I like them, they fit right, and they are ok on comfort. The inside material is terrible quality. It seems to be falling apart to the point I doubted them being authentic."
1,"Poor quality Wished i had read some reviews before purchasing. One broke even before using, the other within two weeks!"
1,"Pretty sure we got fake ones Gf asked me to order for her and she complained that it has a strong chemical smell, product is poorly manufactured and even asymmetrical (which is not what you'd expect from this well-established brand), and the holes in the pad looks like a joke. See the picture for what the pad looks like fresh out of the package."
4,"Works great I use these earbuds when working out and they have worked great. They are really light so after a bit its feels like nothing is there. The design makes it so that they can hold onto your ears really well. AS for sound quality there not the best but its definatly not bad, it almost sounds like its playing from a speaker a few feet in front of you but after a bit you dont notice the werid echo type effect. Overall I think that its a good pair of earbuds that I would reccomend."
4,"Good for occasional use This trimmer is on the inexpensive side. While it has a clean cut, the grating noise as you swing the handle/blade down is irksome. You get some resistance, which to me indicates the blade isn't as sharp as some of the other more professional models out there that I've used. I did 3 layers of cardstock and felt uncomfortable with adding anymore for fear of wrecking something. However on the flip side, I am just using this gor crafts so the price is fantastic for that purpose. My trimmer/scorer combo was getting dull fast and this replaced that. So if light to moderate crafting or a home office is what you need it for, you are ok. If you are a business who trims/cuts a lot, I'd stick to a heftier model and pay the extra. You would be too frustrated on a daily basis.  It's a heavy plastic base and has a lock on the blade handle. The measurements have been spot on, so that is easy to work with."
4,"Good All ink is overpriced imo, but I always buy the hp since some generic cartridges work and some don’t.  I don’t have time for that.  Good quality. Works as it should"
5,"Comfy! In the description I was warned that these run large, so I ordered a size smaller than my normal size. They fit perfectly. I love the color, the fit, the fabric. These are too long for me, but I am quite short and accustomed to shortening all my pants. I'm sure they would fit average to tallish women without seeming skimpy. The hem could be let down, but it is only about 3/4 inch with serging at the bottom. These wash and dry well without shrinkage."
5,"Love it Great ring"
5,"Very flattering for a curvy bum. I dont wear pants EVER, because I dont like my buttcrack hanging out. Not an issue with these pants! I'm a bigger girl, I'm very curvy (smaller waist and very thick thighs and bum) and 5'10"", 190 lbs, and these pants (xxl) fit AMAZING! They are very classy and modern. I really like the length, they will be super cute with a pair of ballet flats. I'm not a huge fan of the material, though. I imagine they will be way too hot to wear in the summer, but come fall they will be a staple piece. They're very thick, and polyester in 100 degree heat is NOT a good idea. All in all, I'm very satisfied and happy I bought these. You turned a strictly skirt/dress wearing girl into a pants wearing girl! Thanks!!"
5,"Excellent Markers, Great Price! One of the best metallic pens you can get.  I use these fine tip Sharpies on greeting cards, envelopes and other stationary items.  The biggest advantage that this has over other metallic pens/markers is that it does smudge or smear on most surfaces.  When I've tried other brands, they typically smear, smudge or sometimes discolor and flake when applying light pressure with your hand or finger.  Impressive markers at a great price!"
5,"Perfect affordable dive watch for small wrist. Love this watch, perfect for the price"
5,"Great This was a gift and the 10 year old loves it"
5,"Very comfortable So glad I finally tried Brooks! They are very lightweight and so comfortable. I wear them to the gym everyday and they have really been a godsend."
5,"Comfiest sweater I have even owned Don't dismay that this fits a larger than expected, you'll be glad it does! This sweater is THICK and SOFT and LONG, perfect for a chilly winter night. I've never dressed it up to wear out of the house, but that's not why I purchased it. The only thing I wish were a little different is the sleeve length. While the garment itself is very long, going well past my knees, the sleeves could be an inch or two longer. But honestly, I hardly notice. This sweater is wonderful!"
5,"Would buy again Love this product"
5,"Perfect length; arrived as shown Perfect length for me"
5,"Very Nice My husband uses a planner regularly so I usually use it as a stocking stuffer every Christmas. I've been sticking with this one for the past several years because he likes it better than all the other ones. It's very clear &amp; simple &amp; user friendly. Not to mention one of the most reasonably priced agendas you will find for how nice it is."
5,"awesome for traveling It is a  wonderful backpack for traveling, can hold multiple things, very sturdy, fashionable and simple. I love the charging port as-well over all i love the bag and would recommend money well spent."
5,"Soft and comfy! Need more in my life! Love the feel and fit. Soft and comfortable during my run tonight. Not too tight, not too loose. Read reviews that said size up and so I did and feel that is accurate."
2,"Not for me. These fit strangely on my shoulders (I have small shoulders) and I am aware 'burnout' means it will have a bit of transparency to them, but the white ones were incredibly see through. I could see the colour of my skin and the dark void of my bellybutton?"
3,"I love it!!! Best backpack I've seen at the price I nabbed this at! I was looking for a fairly waterproof backpack with a USB port that had 15"" padded pocket for my laptop that I could use to also haul my college books and binders and notebooks at a price that was reasonable. Not an easy thing to find and after seeing name brands that lacked the proper waterproofing at $75 and upwards, I wasn't exactly the most hopeful shopper. I haven't put it to the test but I would be VERY surprised if it didn't hold up to my initial baseline expectations. It's not a hard shell but like a hard foam like feel and it's got pockets, pockets, and more pockets! The charging port looks fairly waterproof but I'm using a waterproof case on my power bank either way because common sense said DUH!!! I'll keep my phone tucked in the compartment for it on the inside of the backpack. All in all, I have no issues whatsoever but again...I haven't tested it yet. I'm a pedestrian with a dorm and a part time job. I need to be able to charge on the go and protect my computer equipment since I don't have several hundreds of dollars to replace my stuff. This SEEMS ideal. Once the weather turns and I can test it, I'll try to update. Love the double zippers as well. I have broken loads of zippers and I know having a second zipper is like having a second chance at saving the bag. I've been able to fill it with 2 slim binders, 3 three subject notebooks, 2 pecil cases, a 15"" laptop, 2 tablets enclosed in thick cases, a 17 month planner with an included day-to-day planner, and a slew of other stuff and I still have room in this thing for my books! Its not too heavy when I lift it, considering all the crap inside, and it's easier to cart around using standard backpack fashion (both arms in, backpack on back) and it's not as hard as I was expecting it to be when standing and/or walking from place to place. This a great buy and I encourage you to try it too because it's a game changer.  -EDIT- I had to take 2 stars off because mine was not water resistant even though it claims to be. I didn't go out in pouring rain or anything but my index cards that were in the front pouch got water damaged. The lines that are printed on most imdex cards ran and I felt the inside of the bag and it was wet, not damp, wet. It was like the rain had fallen into an open zipper and if it WERE pouring, I may have have to replace my textbooks."
1,"wasted. Doesn't work, wasted."
1,"Piece of junk Go it, and 2 of the 4 main clips snapped the first time I opened them. Avoid, crap quality."
4,"Cool bag, not heavyweight Terrific reflective bag but straps don't seem like they can handle a lot. Also the straps come lose easily since the straps are glossy"
4,"Comfy fit The waist runs a little bit big but I like the waist band. It sits just under the waistline. There was very little if any shrinkage after washing and drying. The length is good, not too short. I am 5'2"", ~128#, my waist is  30"" and hips measure 35-1/2""."
5,"Unreal Value for TEMENDOUS PRODUCT This is an extraordinarily beautiful and well made product and perhaps the best quality, prestige and beauty for the price in the entire watch industry. I understand that's saying a lot but certainly this is A LOT of watch for an unreal price! This model Orient was terrific even before they made the improvements on these models in 2016. But now, w/ the omission of the independent date button, the addition of a sapphire crystal, a flat finished bezel and improved steel bracelet it is truly remarkable - and a remarkable value for this Japanese made watch w/ Orient's terrific in-house automatic movement. I wish they would have beefed up the clasp on the bracelet - wish it were a bit hardier, but that minor deficiency is overwhelmed by the overall quality of this exquisitely executed time piece. Its truly a winner. I could not be more pleased."
5,"Love this product! Great product.  Powerful, quiet, easy clean-up.  I like it better than the one i was replacing (Russel Hobbs) that cost twice as much."
5,"just like the photo it’s the same quality as any other standard backpack . i thought the poke ball pounce would be cheesy but it’s actually a durable quality . easy to clean and it stands out . my son who is 8 loves this backpack"
5,"A Solar Atomic Watch At A Reasonable Price I purchased this watch from Amazon because I was looking for a watch that was both ""solar"" and ""atomic"" at a reasonable price. This watch also has world time which is convenient when travelling abroad.  Also included are a stopwatch function and a countdown time.One of the nice features of the ""atomic"" function is the multiband 6 which picks up signals from other stations in the world when you are in the vicinity of those stations; the other stations include England/Germany/China/Japan(2) as well as the Colorado signal. It also has an alarm function.  There are other functions as well.  I love mine!!!  `"
5,"Fits snug on my phone and it has a little stand which is very nice! The card holders are a little tight but ... Very cute case. Fits snug on my phone and it has a little stand which is very nice! The card holders are a little tight but that might be because it is still new. There's also a little slot behind the card holder for money and stuff but be careful because I had my bills get stuck. The only small complaint that I have is that the colours faded waaaay to quickly. It was only a few days after I got the case that I saw it started to fad :( So it's not as vibrant as it used to be when I first got it. But everything is still good so I'm happy with my purchase."
5,"Money saver Very life saving for us. The house we purchased has one very dirty, we were not ready to dk the kitchen yet. I decided to reaearch and my husband put it up himself."
5,"Super comfortable to carry and not bulky Holds a lot stuff and very comfortable"
5,"good quality It’s really good and the quality is better than any one I bought before. There is little usb on the side, It’s convenience. So sweet"
5,"Exacto lo que requería Excelente diseño"
5,"Best liner for price. Better than any other liner. It's very soft."
5,"So comfortable These are the only pads I have used for probably five years no other pads live up to these ones"
5,"A great drinking coffee I am not a Starbucks fan on a daily basis but I absolutely love their holiday blend. It's a fantastic daily drinking coffee and I wish they would make it more often than just once a year."
5,"Winner winner chicken dinner!! These came in perfect shape and on the expected date. I really am very pleased with these. I had the Bose noise canceling ear phones that I would use while editing photos and then they broke. I quickly hopped on Amazon and ordered these. They fit well and the sound quality is so impressive for such a little package and reasonable price. I always needed to take my other ones off often because my ears would get so hot. I love that I can answer calls from them and best of all...they fit in your pocket!!"
2,"DON'T DO IT Honestly, the other customers in the reviews looked so cute so i purchased this. It is the most shapeless and ugly dress I have ever purchased.  It literally looks like either a moo moo or a curtain. They took a piece of stretchy nylon material (that stuff that is super cheap and feels like a cross between halloween costume material and a bathing suit) and folded it in half, and sewed up the side. It is a neck/shoulder hole and a hole at the bottom for your legs to come out. The only way to look even somewhat normal in it is to constantly keep your hand on your waist like you are taking an Instagram selfie so it looks like there is a person in yard of fabric, not just Violet Beauregard turning into a blueberry. Kudos to the women who look super cute in this, but its a no from me dawg."
3,"Slightly damaged, but it protects your tech Nice functional backpack, but there were scuffs on one side of it. It’s a nice bag, but it gets irritating when you order a 150 dollar backpack, and its damaged. Very inconvenient, but a nice bag to protect your tech!"
3,"Its just socks........ They are socks...........Do you really need to read a review?"
1,"PRINTS MINIMAL PAGES!!!!! What a joke I have now gone through TWO ink cartridges??  I don't print much I was better off getting a more expensive printer from HP.  total BS!!!"
1,"Too small I don't know who's writing these other reviews, but for $30 this thing is small. It's so stiff it makes it difficult to get in and out of. I'm not the biggest guy, I'm average and I can't wear this on my back. I bought it because it said military grade tough, it's just too tiny. Find another bag."
4,"Love this bag I really loved this bag. Recently took it on a work trip with me and it was so nice that everything had its own place and I knew where to go to find what. The only improvement I would recommend is that the Velcro band on the back to slide over a luggage handle. I had a hard time getting it to slide over the handle without the Velcro reattaching before I got it over the handle. I also wish that strap was broader."
4,"Powerful! The range hood is super powerful that you can actually see the smoke being suctioned into the vent.  Very simple and easy to clean.  It's a little loud,  but since it's so powerful,  we hardly have to leave it on for too long."
4,"I'm a fan! These pants are insanely comfortable and overall worth the price! I did take away 1 star bc there was a small area where I had to sew the seem back together and based on other reviews this wasnt an isolated issue. However, still worth it!"
5,"So Soft This is big as stated.  But is great!  Very Fuzzy and comfortable!  This will be great when the weather is cold and I can wear a turtleneck underneath.  Fits great, could have belt or button but I use my own if I choose to but looks good without too!  Love it!"
5,"Great shorts! Love these shorts! I wear them to train my clients at the gym, not too short and not as see-through as some have said. They are light and they do run a little small so I got a medium. I’m 5’4” and 150 lbs."
5,"Very pleased!!! Great for running. Band doesn’t shift and it fits my iPhone 6+ perfectly."
5,"I love this tea!! If you like cinnamon this is for you. One of the things I love is that it's naturally sweet. I don't have to add sugar to it. It is a little pricey, but you're getting quality tea. I tend to leave my tea bags steeping for longer than the recommended time and it never gets bitter, just a stronger cinnamon flavor. It does get spicy if you do that, but I love it."
5,"Better than expected Sound is really good and they seem really durable.  I couldn't get the clip on the cord, it was too tight and started to crimp the cord by trying to install it multiple times, since I don't really need the clip I just left it off."
5,"Perfect Formula Dispenser I use these every day since my daughter has to have a certain amount of cereal in every bottle due to acid reflux. Its faster than measuring everything out for every single bottle. And these are great for traveling so i dont have to carry around a formula can or cereal box. The three way divider comes out and you can use it as a snack bowl for when they get older! And these are great quality. I've had them for 7 months and they're still like new."
5,"Great product Love the product - easy to use, work well. Like that they are plant based.A couple of things - why is there an applicator? Totally unnecessary and wasteful, but i guess that making it plant based makes up for it. They are as absorbent as other major brands."
5,"LOVE THEM SOFT DOESN'T BUNCH OR BAG BY THE END OF THE DAY. 3 WASHES SO FAR NO PILLING! HOORAY!"
5,"Coffee addicts dream come true! This was one of the gifts I got for my coworker who is a coffee ADDICT. She had never seen one before and was absolutely amazed by it. She has used it almost every day since I got it for her and it is still going strong with absolutely no problem. Keep in mind that this is a coffee mug WARMER. Meaning it will keep your already warm cup of whatever beverage you have, warm. This is not made to head up cold liquids. It is also a really great size, big enough for a larger cup but still compact enough to not take up a ton of real. All in all, this is a really neat product and a super cute gift idea for any coffee/tea/hot chocolate drinker."
5,"This is beautiful timepiece. I am small of stature This is beautiful timepiece. I am small of stature, so it does not look huge on my wrist. The band is comfortable. It keeps perfect time and is a great buy. The vender is of the upper echelon. You cannot go wrong dealing with them."
5,"Im a picky leggings-shopper, and I approve this pair. I left my expectations very low for buying gym leggings online, especially for this kind of price. I am very picky with my leggings, and normally might buy only 1 pair after trying on close to 20 at the mall. You see, for this price, normally what you get are thin and scratchy leggings, made in wrong sizes and, see-through. I played it safe and ordered a black pair. I got these in the mail right on time, and upon opening I immediately noticed they were very nice-looking. They're made from thick material, and definitely of the high-waisted ""tummy-control"" design as advertised. Well, I liked them enough to set them aside as my next day gym apparel, but I didn't even try them on! That's how much I liked them. And trusted them. They fit very nicely the next morning! They are much more snug than I expected the medium to be, but maybe thats just because I have gained a little chunk around the waist and am lying to myself that I'm still a petite size small. Either way, it's okay because that's how I like my tights. ...I just don't think I could wear them comfortably if I were too bloated. Anyways, I will definitely be ordering another pair in a more... risky color. ;-) I had ordered a medium after looking at the sizing chart. I normally order a small for leggings, since legging material is stretchy, but I played it safe, followed my gut feeling l, and got the medium. I'm 5' 1.75"" (5'2"" in with shoes), and around 132 pounds, if that helps anyone."
5,"Leaks, but it's hard to complain for the price UPDATE: August 2016 Just wanted to put a quick update. After my initial review, I was contacted by the company to talk about the dripping issue I was having and they assured me it was not normal operation for the glue gun. At first I didn't care, knowing how good of a deal it was for a glue gun + glue sticks, they offered to send me another set for no-charge. Sure enough, the new glue gun doesn't leak and I'm extremely happy with the value of this glue gun and wouldn't be afraid to offer it to other hobbyists. It's a great value, and the company's customer service in reaching out to ensure I was satisfied made me edit the review from 3 to 5 stars. Don't hesitate to buy this new gun, especially hobbyists, it just gets the job done.  Bought this glue gun for a few hobby projects. For the price you can't really complain, it's pretty simple and diminutive in construction, and hot glues well and has kept up well with the uses I have for it. My only gripe about it is the leaking. Propped on it's stand while not in use, hot glue will drizzle out consistently and I have to dab that blob off before I use it. Kind of a waste of glue, but for around the $10 I paid, I can't complain much in that it melts glue fine and the glue that comes with it seems to work well for most applications."
5,"Five Stars Works! Feel clean!"
5,"Does the job right and lasts forever This toner does the job right. I've never tried knock-off brands as i feel like sticking with the manufacturers brand of toner is probably best, and I have zero complaints. This was easy to install and produces great quality print jobs."
2,"Style ok I have to send back even though I really wanted it......just too small and material a little too thick"
3,"Nice but! My wife loves the necklace but the chain was not connected to the clasp. Have to take it to a jeweler to have it attached."
1,"Doesn’t last!! Beware Nice looking watch while it last, received great compliments. But it does not last long, I rarely used it. About two months ago it come apart. Fall on the ground. Maybe no screws were added to this one. Or they all come out"
1,"Returned it I ended up returning this. Hard to insert and very uncomfortable"
4,"Four Stars I have lights again"
4,"They are a good value, good variety and relatively small. These are a good value and a good variety.  They are worth the money.  I am not sure that l would have purchased them had I fully understood they are usually about the size of a number # pencil eraser.  If you like smaller earrings that size these are a good, tasteful variety."
4,"Simple yet more than Ok The Mr. Coffee Coffee maker was recommened as a buy by Amazom, and I agree, It doesn't have all the fancy features you load it, it plug it in, and turn on the switch, and low and behold a good cup of coffee results. The simplicity may mean there is less trouble. my former coffeemaker (not a M. Coffee) had the programming features but never worked, even after I sent it back for repair. Glad it failed after 5 years."
5,"Must have! Great product. Worn in Canada in -10 F weather and it worked great. Plus it is super comfortable! I wore it on the plane ride over and it was great!"
5,"Definitely worth it Very ,neat and accessible personal blender. I’ve been using it back to back. It’s very helpful cause I can carry this anywhere I go. I can use it as blender or an water bottle just as much."
5,"Perfect size. Keeps me warm. I love these pants! Very comfortable! No issues with the waist band like other reviews had mentioned, maybe they fixed the problem. I wear a size 6 pants &amp; tall, &amp; I bought these in a size small, they are plenty long. Perfect aound the waist. I was also worried about them being too thin &amp; not warm enough, since I bought these in the winter &amp; I live in the mountains, but they are surprisingly warm, but not hot, like they are well insulated &amp; yet can breath too. Very pleased with these pants. Cute style too. I bought the ones that are all speckled gray in the front &amp; black in the back."
5,"Product is good and very gentle Product is good and very gentle. I'm pretty sensitive and it doesn't bother me at all. Definitely love it. Only downside was packaging. It came in with the top busted open and lost some of the product."
5,"Price and nice happy colors 4 PAIRS FOR THE PRICE OF 1..I LOVE AMAZON.. I HAVE HEALTH PROBLEMS AND CAN'T ALWAYS GET OUT! ALSO, PEOPLE ARE NOT NICE SOMETIMES! WHEN YOUR SHOPPING. I USE TO LOVE  TO SHOP AT FRED MEYERS, NOW, UNFORTUNATELY, SOME DO NOT KNOW GOOD CUSTOMER SERVICE1"
5,"It is a gorgeous watch and would recommend this for any man who likes to wear gold I got this for my boyfriend as a Christmas gift. I opened and set it for him to be able to have it ready to wear upon opening. It is a gorgeous watch and would recommend this for any man who likes to wear gold. Classy and sexy."
5,"Nice earbuds It’s very nice wireless earbuds. The voice is very clear. And it’s very comfortable to put on the ear."
5,"Easy to use and good quality Bought this as a gift for my church sister. The color is very nice and fresh, easy to use and no noise. Easy to clean and the taste of the smoothie is great. She is a doctor and ahe says it fits her busy schedule and she brings it to work everyday. Lovely"
5,"Pleased I love this bracelet.  The colors and it stays off which I found out is not the case with all bracelets."
5,"Very nice, room for layering Fancier than expected XL, has plenty of room for layering  for extra warmth. I would buy again if or when they get more colors in. Right now they  only have 4 variations of Grey."
5,"I’d buy many more... It’s snug but I bought it that way."
5,"Beaitiful I received this as a Christmas present and am really impressed. The finish on the kitty charm is is difficult to describe...like a bright matte silver finish, I love it. Make sure you look at the dimensions of the charm. My dad, who bought it for me, thought it would have been bigger based on the pictures. I like how small and dainty it is though!"

While walking, I noticed someone wearing this Hikpro in black and took a photo of it on my smartphone, so I'd remember the brand. I bought the 'army green' version and LOVE the color. It is really a spruce green as shown in the photo, more than an army green, and it is so attractive. The shoulder straps are a tiny bit padded, just enough not to fold and bend, and very comfortable. The Hikpro is very lightweight, but roomy. I love the inside and outside zippered pockets. I like the 2 mesh water pockets, though my water bottle slips out of it; I don't know how these could be improved, perhaps an inch deeper? The zippers are great and everything looks good quality.  WASHING: I was concerned about the questions/answers I read about not washing in washing machine, since it is a backpack, after all, meant to be used and gotten dirty. The company was very communicative to my email about washing and wrote me this reply to my question about cleaning it in washing machine:  ""Thanks for choosing us. We are here to assistent you until you are fully satisfied. • Hikpro backpack sure can be hand washed and drip dried. • And I think hikpro version 3.0 also could be machine washed in a laundry bag because we have improved the fabric to be much more durable. • But if there any damages to hikpro daypack, I will send you a new one. You can have a try. • Because hikpro backpack is water resistant, there a waterproof lining on fabric, too intense friction will cause the lining easily to fall off.  I hope you will satisfied with my answer. Best wishes.  Summary: This version (3.0) can be machine washed  it in a mesh laundry"
2,"Black marks on bag Black marks on bag straight out of packaging"
3,"Almost there I really liked the pants from the crotch down! Fit the legs nicely and was long enough for my 5'10"" stature. The fabric too was great. BUT was really weird in the lower abdomen/crotch area. All the attention seemed to go there because that is where the fabric collects and the pockets are pulled toward. Not ideal for someone who has a bit of a belly. And the waistband was a bit too tight. I think if they had 1 size bigger, I might have tried that one and it would have been perfect. But, no such luck."
3,"Three Stars Little bit flimsy."
1,"product does not fit umbrella or water bottle as stated Did not like the size of umbrella holder or water bottle holder ..does not fit . looks cheap"
1,"Listen to me DONT BUY Do not get it !!!  It makes you burn down there i almost cried and these people wanted me to send it back after its been up my hoo Haa to get a refund . Dont buy !!!"
1,"One Star I got unbranded sunglasses in a Tom Ford package. What do you call this???"
4,"Keep it light. If you're looking for durability, this will absolutely suit your needs. I've taken it hiking, camping and biking and it's held up majestically. When you first get yours, it will be rigid, but it does break in over time. It's designed really well for light to moderate carrying, but if you intend on really loading it up and carrying it for extended periods, it will get pretty uncomfortable. The hip belt isn't at all designed for tall people (I'm 6'4"") and it rides high. My biggest issue is with the hip belt and its mounts. The mounts where it meets the pack are stiff and sharp. They dig into my sides and it really knocks the comfort down a bit.  It's a very well orginized pack, which serves me well. I carry it to work with a moderate amount of fill (mostly lightweight) and I've never had an issue with the bag's layout.  I've made use of the bladder pouch with a 2 liter camleback and found that it ride fairly well when I bike/hike with it.  I recommend it for light to mid weight and light to mid length of wear. It is not the most comfortable, but it is very durable and well orginized. I enjoy mine, but I don't think I'd get this model again."
4,"Seems OK Testing right now. It was cheaper than the other product I used with more mg... I will have to monitor over time"
5,"Excellent Stuff When we took a road trip across Canada this fall we became aware that Tim Horton's shops were as plentiful in the country as McDonald's and Dunkin Donuts are in the U.S. and their medium flavored coffee had a rich deep taste without it being bitter or overwhelming. These coffee beans grind nicely and continue to remind me of that delicious flavor."
5,"Great design, good quality. This was a really good shirt for Halloween. Good quality. The only downside was I ordered 4 shirts at one time, 2 arrived early, (like Prime 2-day) early and one arrived later and another arrived even later. Not too late but it was annoying as they had been ordered together for a Halloween themed photo we planned on taking. We were going away for it so I washed the last one that day and let it air dry in the car."
5,"Fits 17.3 Lenovo Legion gaming computer We tried several backpacks labeled as being able to fit a 17.3"" gaming computer.  This was never the case!  However, this backpack did indeed fit the 17.3"" Lenovo Legion gaming computer with some room to spare."
5,"Lots of room inside. Yet quite compact. I  met someone at the airport who had a jansport. She recommended it to me and I am glad she did. I love the color (mint green). But more important, it is so well designed. There are two deep sleeves for books and a laptop. And smaller pockets for whatever: pens, pencils, little notebooks, etc. Lots of room. And it's still very compact. I am a teacher. So the JanSport gives me enough space for papers and books. It sits comfortably on my back and the weight is evenly distributed. I also like the leather stitching at the bottom. It reinforces the weight and I think it will help save wear and tear.I take good care of it as I want it to last. I love it."
5,"Great product I needed this for my Kuurig coffee maker. It worked extremely well. I also like the fact that it did NOT leave any funny taste in the coffee maker. I had a problem with another brand where I had to keep running water through for it seemed like forever to get the taste out. No issue w this one! The 2 pack is also a great value.  Each bottle has enough for two cleanings. Very satisfied and will buy again."
5,"Great product Love their jewelry, bracelets are beautifully made.  I have purchased several bracelets as gifts,  everyone loves them."
5,"Thanks to my Casio I love my Casio watch. its a little hard to set up but all you need is a technical genius to help you. I got my watch for my job as a lifeguard and Im so exited to use it this summer. I had one a couple of years ago and it worked perfectly when I went scuba diving."
5,"These are awesome! These leggings/ yogapants are pretty awesome for the price. They have so many different colors and they are vibrant and pretty. The pockets are decently sized as I demonstrated with my hand. It fits a samsung s9. I'm usually a size US 15,16, or 17 in pant size. I got a large which fits, but I say to be extra comfy, I would go with a size xl. It's got decent tummy control and not too high waisted, the very top does tend to flip over though. Also as everyone else says, it's not see through an soooo soft!"
5,"Nice bag Best price we could find.  This bag is big."
5,"Love it! Great color, a bit too large, but hopefully it’ll shrink a bit in the wash. If not, it’s still awesome!"
5,"Highly recommend These are awesome. I bought a pair for myself and I loved them so much I bought a pair for my mom and sister. I will be buying more for Christmas presents."
5,"Beautiful rose Lovely necklace, very happy with my Purchase"
5,"Great blender! Really like this blender for my morning shakes. Works perfectly. I would recommend."
2,"Great coffee; dangerous internal flaw I love all but one thing about this coffee maker. Ease of use, programability, great tasting coffee, and aesthetics all are there. A+ all around.  The internal water transport tubes that carry water from the reservoir to the 'showerhead' tend to fail over time, however. This causes water to evacuate through the electrical inlet at the lower rear of the device and flood the countertop. A review of internet commentary suggests that this is a relatively common problem.  When this happened to my ~16 month old unit, I stepped through the (3 year) warranty replacement process as outlined in the Cuisinart documentation accompanying the product and promptly received a new unit. So three cheers for customer service.  A known materials problem that dumps water onto a live electrical circuit is dangerous scenario, though, so despite the many positive attributes this coffee maker offers, I cannot recommend it."
3,"Not the same as the old one I had I had one with the stand. And the brush worn out a little bit. So I decided to buy another brush only one. However, this one doesn’t feel the same way to the old one. It has less density of the ‘hair’."
3,"Love the pocket idea but not the rest of it Was not a spandex wicking material like I expected (seemed like cotton), and you could see my printed underwear through the pants.  Not going to work for me, but sizing seemed true to size.  I wear 2x old navy pants, these fit about the same"
1,"Didn't work for me. This did not work for me at all. I did my due diligence and tried it for 3 months. I don't want to tell people ""don't waste your money"" because I see from some other reviews that it has worked wonders for some people. I'm just not one of them. My advice to you is give it a try and hopefully you'll feel better."
4,"Nice watch. A little on the flashy side Nice watch. A little on the flashy side, so fine for going out but to much bling for me for everyday activities. Dial has a classy look. The band's not quite right. The gold has a high polish and the silver is brushed with polished sides. The bezel matches with polished gold and brushed silver with polished sides."
4,"... pocket on the back competently broke off making it useless. Other that than that I like the product After less than a weeks worth of use the zipper on the smaller pocket on the back competently broke off making it useless. Other that than that I like the product, unfortunately I can't recommend it, who knows what else will break.  Update... Kopack sent me a new backpack at no cost to me, since then the new bag has held up. Other than the initial disappointment I find no fault in the bag (hopefully I just got one from a bad batch). I commend Kopack for their quick customer service making the situation right, would buy from them again!"
4,"They work but they’re fragile I really like the feel of being fresh after using these wipes. I’ve always been the type that my PH gets out of wack more often than not, these really helped keep everything in check and smelling fresh. However, my main issue is that rip when trying to pull them out the package.."
5,"Five Stars Very effective and comfortable.  No leaks."
5,"Bought for the Look with Shorts. I bought this so not to have the sock all the way up to my knee when wearing shorts. They worked to control my foot/ankle swelling. I wore them all day, only issue was the swelling above the sock."
5,"An Attractive, Quality, Well Built Watch All the positive reviews of this nice watch are well deserved.  It is a beautiful combination of blues, a color to which I am partial. Someone had commented that the dial looked more black in some lighting, but it looks blue to me all day. It has a nice presence on the wrist. I have many divers watches - some expensive and others not. This Citizen stands up in aesthetics and quality to many of them. The bezel is strong and rotates with a firm amount of resistance and is easy to grip by its nicely machined scallops. The markers and hands are substantial and attractive and they glow nicely in the dark. The band is a bit stiff as others have mentioned, but it is not at all uncomfortable. It is plenty long. My wrist is small and I will need to cut off about 1/2"" so it looks better.  It was not ticking when I took it out of the box, but within a few minutes of exposing it to ambient light, it started up.  It has survived a couple of hot tubs and I'm sure it will hold up under more challenging submersions. Let's face it, even most casual divers do not go to the depths that would challenge a quality diver's watch. The screw-down crown gives one confidence, especially if pondering its susceptibility to water intrusion. and its location at 4 o'clock is great because when it slides down on my wrist, a flexed wrist does not bind on the crown.  I now have four sport/divers watches that I will probably never wear again, since I am tired of replacing batteries."
5,"Great fit and comfortable! I use these to wear to barre, hot yoga and pole fitness. They are very comfortable and for true to size. I am very curvy so I was worried how these would fit on me but they are quite flattering. I am 5'9 and 160lbs. I wear size 9/10 in pants and I am happy I decided to order a size medium! They fit snug but not tight and I can move around easily. They do ride a bit during class but any fabric would! I would buy another pair!"
5,"Adorable backpack. My granddaughter loves it Adorable backpack.  My granddaughter loves it!!"
5,"Loved it Great watch. Very comfortable to wear."
5,"Great bag Bought this bag for edc and camping and I must say I am not disappointed. The bag is a little stiff but as I wear it it seems to be breaking in so that isn't a problem. Love the organization of the bag and the heavy duty feel to the bag. I highly recommend it to those in need of a high quality bag.  Only con though is after wearing fir a while the upper middle of my back feels a little strained but that could be from still working on adjusting it and second the price seems a little much but even with those I still give this bag five stars."
5,"High Impact! This sports bra is the best one I've owned. I workout 5 days a week running and doing hot yoga, and it definitely has a ton of support. I would suggest going true to size as that's how you will get the best support."
5,"Yep, they're envelopes They work exactly like you'd expect envelops to work... You can put stuff inside them...  They're designed for folded paper or checks, but I suppose you could put just about anything inside and use the self seal to keep it from getting out."
5,"Very nice I love these pencils.  They are much better than the pencils that have to be sharpened. Easy to write with. Nice eraser on each one. Now that I have these pencils, I won't use any other kind."
5,"Replacement for Original Broke the one that came with my coffee maker so this was an exact replacement - good product, no issues with the product.  This order was fulfilled by Amazon and came in a box you would see on a store shelf - no shipping box.  The third item from Amazon this Christmas received without a shipping box.  What is this?  This item is made of glass and the box it came in was pretty thin.  Lucky it didn't break.  Same with the other two items I got without proper boxes."
5,"Good Same as expected. Product received in good condition. Quality is good, it works as intended. Value for money spent."
5,"Works on any size bottle We have a few different bottle brushes including the munchkin and Tommee Tippee brush. I like this one the best. The bristles are flexible enough to get into nearly any size bottle, including the little Medela pumping bottles, and firm enough to get the bottles clean. The nub on the other end for nipples is okay but certain seems more effective that the little wire thing that comes with the munchkin brush and its much easier to access than Tommee Tippee's nipple cleaner. Tommee Tippees brush is also pretty good in comparison but it is a bit wider and it flicks water everywhere when you pull it out of thinner necked bottles (like Medela) and the nipple scrubber is hard to get to. Once you snap the handle in, its hard to get it back off."
2,"Small and Itchy These are really poor quality. I almost wonder if I got a fake version? They are very thin (like the socks you see at the dollar store), and itchy. They definitely don't seem Adidas quality. I'm not delusional, so I'm not looking for hand spun wool that feels like silk or anything ridiculous, but these are really not great. Also, I wear a size 6, and these are none-too-big. I doubt they would fit (much) larger feet."
3,"Odd fit Thick and warm, however it’s oddly sized. I ordered a small, I’m normally an XXS. The sleeves shrunk after washing, making them a tad too short, they fall just above my wrist, but the bicep area of the sleeves is oddly baggy, and the rest of the sleeve is tight. The neck doesn’t go down far enough in my opinion, I wear underneath scrubs and don’t like my undershirt being seen under my scrubs with exception of the sleeves. It is warm, but I wouldn’t order again due to the odd fit."
1,"keypad scratches easily This microwave looks nice, however the drawer is slow to open/close, doesn't seem to be as powerful as our previous countertop microwave, and worst of all the key pad is already scratched up badly (only one week old).  I'm nervous that with time we will not be able read what he buttons are.  Also, when I push a button near the top of the keypad, the panel closes, which smashed my finger.  Now I hold it with my other hand."
1,"Worst headphones ever. The worst sound of any headphones I’ve ever used.  They make music painful.  Do not buy.  Why would anyone ever give these headphones a good review?  This is crazy.  Total crap, especially for the price and the hype. Uncomfortable, too. If these were the only headphones available in the universe, I would just stop listening to music."
1,"Stopped working after first water exposure I enjoyed my previous Anker Soundcore Spirit earbuds because I could use them in the shower or bath to listen to podcasts, so when I lost them I went right back to Soundcore for a new pair. These seemed like an upgrade, having no wire connecting the earpieces. The sound was great for the first day, better than my old pair, but when I went to take a shower, the right earpiece stopped working.  I am disappointed and will be making a return on these. The product is clearly not IPX7 resistant."
4,"Nice look good price I like this bracelet very much. And it's a great price. And it looks good. I just don't wear it everyday because it seems so delicate. Like if I stretch it too much you will break. But only time will tell."
4,"Great gift These were a gift. I can’t rate them entirely. Recipient was happy to get them"
5,"Great! I am a teacher and I use these for various activities in the classroom! They are perfect!"
5,"Traveling bag Locks of pockets"
5,"Most comfortable earrings I've ever worn. I was initially concerned when I opened the bag and saw the weird screw-up backs. I've never worn earrings like this. I decided to give them a try after sanitizing them. Honestly, they are so comfortable I forget I'm wearing them. I wear them 24/7 and even shower with them in. I love that the backs are as solid as the front - no more posts sticking me behind my ears."
5,"I have glue sticks for years...a glue stick for you, one for you and one for you. This is a deal. Tired of spending 15$ on glue sticks for school and still never having any at home? This is perfect."
5,"Small footprint, matches other stainless appliances, works great! After moving into my house I had to really downsize a lot of my kitchen gadgets.  My kitchen is TINY with minimal cabinet storage and even less counter space.  One of the items I had to rehome was my full-size blender.  It wasn’t something I used often, but I really missed having smoothies in the morning and as treats on hot summer days.  I picked up this Homgeek  blender because it seemed like a great value with a small footprint and an attractive stainless design that matched the rest of my appliances.  I found that it worked better for me than my full size blender bc of the simplicity - one speed, one button, made in a personal size cup that I could toss a lid on and take with me.  It’s easy to clean and even comes with an extra cup.  No, this isn’t a Vita-mix but this isn’t what it’s trying to be. It’s the perfect mini compact blender for smoothies &amp; iced coffee drinks.  I’ve been using it for about a month now and have no complaints, I don’t miss my giant blender at all."
5,"Five Stars Excellent product!"
5,"Good Worked well for my son!. I needed to cut the straw though it was too long for my son."
5,"Five Stars Works like a gshock should. No complaints"
5,"Strong! It has stronger power than I thought. Very easy to use and clean. I use this to make smoothies everyday!"
5,"Size- great for small spaces We need a small unit for 2 separate kitchenettes - love the unit and it’s size.  Perfect for our needs.  Both Work like a champ  so far..."
5,"One word - LOVE These shoes fit perfectly, and they look and feel like the high quality you would expect from Nike. My last 5 pair of shoes have been Under Armour. Wasn’t getting the support my feet needed from their shoes lately so decided to go back to Nike. So glad I did. This shoe is very comfortable, lightweight, gorgeous and made to last with high quality material. I wear a size 8 and have narrow feet. I didn’t size down, the 8 is just right. Also, on my hardwood floors the traction and grip is just fine - no sliding around whatsoever. With or without socks these shoes are Amazing!! :-)"
5,"Five Stars This was a gift for my daughter and she loves it and wears it every day."
5,"A Staple I just keep re-ordering these. I have a pretty heavy flow so these are my ""regular"" pads and I use thicker ones for overnight ."
2,"Printer works well but has some major flaws. this printer prints well. I’ve printed a few hundred pages and have had no problems so far, not even a jam. Was very easy to set up to my phone.  Here are my issues with it:  *you can only load the paper through the top in a sort of old fashion way that takes up a lot of space, and can’t take many pages at a time so I’m constantly reloding.  If I had realized this didn’t have a tray for paper I would have probably gone with something else.  *you can’t print double sided.  *you will find when you get an HP printer that now they have their own subscription service for ink. Unless you print a ton of high color images that drain ink, DON’T SIGN UP FOR THIS (even then...). It’s actually pretty creepy and dare I say a little scammy getting texts to my phone telling me that I’m reaching my “page limit” for the month and that I will be charged to print any more. And then when you cancel, your ink will stop working immediately because they all have computer chips in them. I wish this was just a service to send ink when I’m low so I don’t run out, I don’t know who wants to have “roll over pages” like a phone with minutes in 2001.  They push it pretty hard with a three month free trial but let me tell ya, it’s a pain in the butt to quit and those thee free months are just to ensure that you run out of starter ink the printer comes with and switch over to their creepy computer chip ink."
3,"Calls sound muffled and far away Sound quality was good. Ear buds need to be a little different too get more of a suction for bass sound too be better. Making calls was hard since everyone said I sounded muffled and far away. Was annoying having the button pushed every time I put them in my ears lol"
1,"NOT WATER RESISTANT NOT WATER PROOF. Unfortunately was in the rain with my law text books in my backpack... I now have water damaged books.."
4,"Perfect oversized hoodie dress. Long delivery time. I love this hoodie dress! I bought it for wearing around the house during the freezing winter. Color and quality is great, BUT it took almost a full month to get here. I got multiple alerts that it was lost and misplaced during transit, but it eventually showed up. Other than that, it fits as expected and is just what I wanted. 5’4” 140lbs and a medium is loose in the body and fits perfect in the arms."
4,"Great bag but one star off Durability Likes: 1. The bag is big and accommodates the laptop perfectly. I even have enough room to pack a MacBook Pro 2015, a galaxy tab S and some clothes in the bag. 2. The fabric used to craft the bag looks and feels premium but I can't say the same on the bag zippers heads.  Dislike: 1. The zipper heads on the side pocket of my bag is broken. Compared to the quality and durability of the zippers heads on the Vindicator for the AW17R3, these look to be made from cheap material. 2. The AW head on the bag is made from metal now. On the Vindicator for the AWR3 the AW head was made of rubber. In my case I feel rubber is better than the metal because the paint job on the metal head is done poorly. The paint chips off."
4,"Solid backpack with one flaw that's relatively irritating Very solid backpack. The leather pockets are a nice touch and definitely give it a premium feel. The rest of the backpack is a canvas/nylon feeling material and does seem like it will be relatively durable. The main pocket has lots of extra compartments, comes with a ""neatness"" bag, and a USB type c cable. The card inside the bag said it also came with a ""packing cube"". I don't know what that is and it doesn't seem to have actually been included. The USB charging port works perfectly and there is tons of space in the main pocket. The side pocket fits a small umbrella perfectly and can expand to fit a water bottle as well. The padding on the straps and back is also very thick, which makes it extremely comfortable to wear. My only complaint, and my reason for giving it 4 stars in lieu of 5 is the front pockets. They have no extra compartments whatsoever. They're just glorified zippered pouches. They're not awful, but they don't allow for any organization at all. Basically just toss stuff in there and hope for the best. I got this backpack on a lightning deal for $48. Definitely worth that price. For the regular price of $68? I might have passed."
5,"Perfect Hiking/Backpacking Bag Originally bought this for a trip to Colorado to use when hiking through the Rockies and was a great choice compared to more expensive brands. Holds plenty of clothes and gear, and had no issues with using as a personal item on flights or getting through TSA. Additionally I have used this for weekend camping trips and hikes without any issues. Quality is great and doesn't hurt my back no matter what I've packed in it. Don't hesitate to buy, this is a great backpack."
5,"This isn't a set 'm 5'4 208lbs 38B curvy. I bought an XL I could've got an L in the pants... XL jacket wearing with a tee/ sleeveless or XXL  to wear a long sleeve shirt or sweat shirt under  the jacket. keep in mind if you have big arms like me don't forget to go up in the jacket size if you like room ....."
5,"Good size and quality I wore this to several different events and I was able to store a lot ! Good quality for the price."
5,"This is my favorite pumpkin coffee so far The flavor is just right, not too strong and not too weak. This coffee is tasty even hours later in my travel mug. I have tried so many brands of pumpkin, but this is by far my favorite."
5,"Great unit This is an amazing unit. This is my 4th one to on. It seems to be standard equipment in upper end motorhomes.  I recently purchased another couch and wanted to upgrade to stainless steel look.  This unit works better than my Samsung in my house.  I paid twice as much for it.  I don’t understood the other reviews that rate it lower.  None of the units I have owned ever failed. I use a coach more than half a year for my business travel.  All my cooking is done with it.  Looking back at past 20 years of service the cost of ownership is 8 cents a day.  I have zero complaints."
5,"Good Hood I got this at such a good price and installed it myself and saved even more."
5,"Smart and sleek on me. Just as expected. Beautiful and smart."
5,"VERY SHARP WATCH The watch looks a lot classier in person. The picture doesn't really do it justice. I had reservations. I thought the display looked more like a child's watch. I was very wrong. If you are familiar with G-Shocks it's easy to set and use. The sleep mode will really prolong the battery. This is my second solar powered G-Shock. The band is huge. Most people will probably need to remove a link or two. My wrist is 81/2 inches. I took out 2 links so it would fit properly. If you plan on doing it yourself you'll need small tools and a lot of patience. That was a minor thing. A great watch at an affordable price."

The moment I wore it, I had that feeling of freedom because I was able to move around my apartment doing my chores while I'm still able to hear what's going on in the video that I was following/watching.  Actually, for two days now I was watching this Dallas trial live on Facebook.  The ear buds proved to go on for 6 hours on both days that I used it.  Amazing that I can say it can be compared to those made by known brands/companies.  First time I wore it at 8:15Am and at around 2:10 PM I heard a notification saying that the battery was low and around 2:25 PM or 2:30PM it went off.  Love this earbuds set, sound produced is excellent, material of good quality and of reasonable price.  I was also able to get calls recorded in the call recorder app that I have in my phone.  I could not do that with the Sony wired earphones.  So glad to replace it with these Kungix earbuds!"
5,"Great product Great quality, shipped very fast, arrived way before it said it would. I have been wearing it for a few weeks and in the shower and it’s fine. Does not  irritated  my skin at all and I have very sensitive skin"
5,"Very satisfied Looks and fits as expected"
5,"Great gift This necklace made a great gift for my mother in law. There is a nice weight to this necklace. I love how the secret message really is a secret and is hidden by the flower. The gold is a warm gold and there is an antique look to the necklace. Really pleased with this gift and my mother in law loves it."

I've also been harder on it than basically any other backpack I've had. I have taken it on two rather large trips, and stuffed it to the brim each time, and it has shown no real signs of breaking down or wearing out. Pros: -It's rated to 17 inch laptops, but it actually fit my gargantuan ASUS laptop, which had a 17 inch screen, with about an inch of clearance on all sides. -Great amount of room, managed to fit all of my books, computer, iPad, cords for everything, and notebooks, all while keeping them relatively safe and tightly packed so that my books and papers don't get totally shredded. -Lots of convenient pockets. Starting from the Laptop pocket and moving forward:   -Laptop pocket has enough room for more than one laptop, if needed, has a protective sleeve and plenty of padding on the back.   -Small cell-phone pocket in between laptop and main pocket is awesome. I usually keep all my cords in it.   -Main pocket is roomy and spartan. No useless pockets in here, it's meant entirely to store books, and it does that well.   -Secondary main pocket looks like it's a half pocket, for storing phones, wallets, etc, but it's actually full size. It fits my entire iPad, and that's usually where I kept it.   -Outside pocket is nice, has lots of little utility pockets for pencils cards and other things.   -Mesh Pockets are functional, if small.   -Straps work great for holding larger things, I've actually used them to hold shoes when I need an extra pair on a trip. Cons(Nitpicks, really): -Could use a decent chest strap -Not as comfortable as some backpacks I've used(then again, these were actual backpacking backpacks, so YMMV) -Laptop pocket doesn't open per TSA standards for quicker wait times. -Waterbottle pockets don't fit any sane size of waterbottle. -Bottom is a little thin, so dropping it on hard surfaces is not something you should do. -Cell Phone pocket on strap is useless, or I just don't know what it's actually for. -No rain fly."
2,"G without the shock? Ok, let's be honest with ourselves.  How many of us really need a shock proof (shock resistent actually) watch?  Unless we're on a S.W.A.T. team or military special forces, we most likely don't.  So, instead of a huge and expensive block of plastic on our wrist, why not try this out instead?  You won't be disappointed. Let's get this out of the way, too - Amazon messed up on the item description - the crystal is plastic and not mineral glass as Amazon describes.  Thus, it will scratch more easily than mineral glass.  Amazon really needs to change this description. That aside, this is a great watch, especially for the price.  The hands and numerals are easily seen and the luminosity on the hands lasts at least 8 hours.  There is no luminosity on the numerals.  The small digital display only is lit by the press of the light button.  That digital display is quite small, but it is legible.  Setting and using all of functions of this watch takes some time and patience as it is somewhat complicated, but after a little use, it becomes easier.  Especially if one just uses the basic functions, it's not so difficult at all.  The watch face has a very nice 3 dimensional look to it with a raised interior bezel, slightly raised numerals and a grid pattern to the inner part of the dial. This watch is light, comfortable and thin compared to similar watches, not getting stuck under jacket cuffs.  For about $32 it's water resistant down to 100 meters, not feet, but meters!  I wear it swimming, in the jacuzzi, and shower without fear and without the display ever fogging up.  And it's recharged by the sun!  No needing to change the battery!  In 6 years, it will have paid for itself.  Now that's a great value.  It did take about 3 days sitting on a  sunny shelf for the charge to go from medium to high after it first arrived, but ever since then it's never moved off of high (or HI as it's listed in the readout) in over 6 months. I normally wear Citizen Eco Drives, which are excellent watches, but needed a ""beater"" watch for work around the house and for the gym.  This watch fits the bill perfectly and cheaply.  I grew tired of Timex watches and cheap department store watches - all of which only lasted a year or so.  Casios seem to last and last. It's a tough and great ""little"" watch.  If I can't be wearing one of my Citizens, I'm very happy with this watch.  You will be too.  Update:  After just over two years of use, the hour hand suddenly doesn't line up with the hour any more - falling between the hours, it's impossible to tell at a glance just what time it is (the whole reason why I wanted an analog display).  Tried to re-set it several times, still no help. Emailed Casio customer support - no response.  Very frustrating, since I was hoping this watch would last for several years (why I wanted solar).  I guess I learned my lesson.  ""Beater"" watches are throw-away watches.  They're good for a couple of years, then no more.  I bought an Armitron to replace this for 1/3 the price.  No sense in investing extra for a solar powered watch if it, too, will only last a couple years.  Too bad, I really liked this watch"

If you load more than 1 page to print, they catch on each other and will not print right. The blue on the top and bottom is rough, so I can tell why they are not being picked up separately by the printer. I called Avery, and they said only put 1 sheet in at a time. Yeah right!

4,"Great deal, great bottles. Would order again. I ordered these because the three pack at the stores had the slow flow nipples and were a little more pricey and seem to cater to the girls with only pink ever being available. So for my grandson I ordered the blue elephants they are great bottles he’s a bit picky in nipples that he would take after my daughter stopped nursing him. He seemed to like these. So I ordered them they arrived early and all except one lid was perfect. (It’s more of a cosmetic issue but I was a little bummed so I knocked off a star for that reason only.) We recently had to buy the larger nipples and swapping them out was easy."
5,"Highly recommend This works fantastic to make mashed potatoes"
5,"Great buy I like them they are a little hard to get in. They are lightweight.  They look nice when they are in"
5,"So yea ... My daughter was just not interested in them at all. Her first foods were with a spoon and thats all she would accept after that. The couple times i tried it, they did work great, nothing leaked. Tiny bit of a pain to wash by hand.

They’re gorgeous, company works great on you if sizing is an issue, and great for busy people using their hands. I work in healthcare and these are so perfect just about every woman at my job has silicone rings!"

I am hoping the socks work well and keep peoples' feet warm and dry this winter.  They look like great socks! Thank you!"
5,"Im shocked When I bought this watch, I truly did it because I wanted to see how good it truly was. If it ended up being terrible, I wouldn’t be mad. But it isn’t like that at all. It is more accurate than my orient ray II. I get so many looks and compliments when I am wearing this, and it simply looks amazing. Buy this watch. Its definitely worth it."
5,"Loose fitting shirt I like to wear shirts like this under dressy type shirts to keep warm.  It is a bit loose fitting for that, but I got an XS instead of a S, so it works okay.  The material feels great (soft).  I got the red, yellow, silver and black and the fit is pretty consistent.  Note on the yellow, it is pretty see-through, but I wear a camisole under it and it is still super comfortable.  Love them all."
5,"Best Price Ever for Coffee Filters! Great product and even better price! I was putting off order this filter for my coffee maker, but I found this at Amazon.com. The product is exactly what I needed. The $8.95 for 12 pieces is much, much better than $8.95 for two pieces at the store. Perfect fit and works great."
5,"Scotch - always reliable! Does what it's supposed to. As reliable as any other Scotch tape dispenser.

We bought a bunch of ""Sk'oodl'e Transparent Tape Refill"" at a good deal, but those didn't fit the dispenser, as the tape doesn't have standard size inner hole cutout."
5,"Fit well but would order smaller next time. Comfortable. I weigh 140 lbs, and am 5 ft exactly. My measurements are 34 in waist, 36 in hips, and 27 inseam. I ordered a medium and they fit well, and are very comfortable, but I wanted something a little more snug so I would order a small next. Definitely squat proof! They’re good for working out or just something comfortable around the house."
5,"Five Stars Exactly as described"
2,"Decent for listening, not so decent for communicating I've had issues with the microphone since I got these.  They are decent for listening to music and watching video, although when switching devices, I'll have to put the buds into the charging case to reset them and then turn off the device I was previously connected to before I try to connect to the new device.  When it comes to talking on the phone or connecting to a computer for a video conference, the sound quality greatly decreases. I can hardly hear what anyone is saying because the sound cuts out. Anyone else can hardly hear me because it sounds like I'm talking through a tin can.  I would spend the extra $20-30 for a better set of headphones in the future."

I wish it had a pull handle rather than the push in latch, which sometimes sticks and even after the latch opens the door you have to pull the door open.  Our first one broke when one of the circuit boards went out, and would have been over $100 for a new one plus the labor and time. Not worth it, so we bought a new one at a very good price, and this time got the 5-year extended warrantee."

We have discovered these smaller markers sometimes wipe off easier after being up for several weeks.  The smaller tips allow for more precise writing on our office calendar. Each staff member has an assigned color so we buy these frequently.  Haven't noticed them drying out easily, either."
5,"Thoroughly enjoying the durability, battery life, and sound quality of these affordable Anker SoundBuds Curve headphones. Thoroughly enjoying the durability, battery life, and sound quality of these affordable Anker SoundBuds Curve headphones.  Prior to these headphones, I was using the Jaybird Bluebuds X and found that the sound quality on those headphones were decent, but only if you could get a secure fit. Unfortunately, with the Bluebuds X, they would slide out slightly during both cardio and weight lifting workouts regardless of what combination of in-ear hooks or pads I used. So for the price, I was disappointed with the fit, which lead to disappointment with the sound quality for the Bluebuds X.  I saw the Anker Soundbuds on sale a couple of weeks ago and thought ""Why not?"" Straight out of the package, I was surprised with out well the headphones fit into my ear and the added secure fit of the over-ear hooks. In my opinion, the sound quality is significantly better than the Apple earbuds supplied with your iPhone and more comfortable as well. I'm still testing the battery life to see if it actually does get the 20 hours that Anker claims. As of now, I've only had to charge it twice through 2 1/2 weeks of daily use. Also, the bluetooth connection has been solid, and I have not had any issues walking 20-30 feet away from my phone (no walls between/ direct line of sight) and skipping, which I experienced often with my Bluebuds X.  I would highly recommend these headphones for anyone looking for an affordable bluetooth headphones for exercise, commuting, and regular use throughout your day."

5,"Just what I needed TLDR at bottom of review  Just a little instructional that might help a first time cup user 😌 Always wash your hands before touching your vagina, especially near your cervix. Relax your uterine muscles and locate your cervix so you know just how deep to insert the cup. Using 1 finger, fully insert it until you reach ""the end"" of your vagina, it will feel like a soft round sponge. My cervix is very high and I have a tilted uterus, I have no problems using this cup. There are several ways to fold the cup, play around with options until you find a comfortable fold. Insert the cup similar to how you would a tampon, aiming towards your tailbone rather than straight up. When you get the cup at least 3/4 in, gently allow the cup to unfold then slowly push the rest of the way in. All the way. Some pics will make it appear as if the cup is sitting right inside the vagina but if you actually have a vagina you'll know that isn't gonna stay put. You'll know it's in place because it will feel as if nothing is even there. If there's any discomfort you should remove it and try again. If it hurts to go to the bathroom, number 1 or 2, chances are you don't have the cup inserted properly. You should be able to comfortably pee and poo without even noticing your cup is in you. If your cup is leaking, chances are it's not inserted correctly or you need a larger size. Every vagina is different so don't base your needs off the manufactures suggestions. I am 30 years old and have given vaginal birth 4 times, I use a small cup. To remove the cup, you're supposed to pinch the base to release suction. But I find that I have to pinch much higher to release suction, almost to the lip. To clean my cup during use I simply rinse with warm water and wipe away the ""uterine slime"" with my fingers, using mild hand soap seemed to irritate my vagina. After my period was over I boiled it as explained in the instruction book, then stored it in the storage bag it came with. Once I became comfortable with inserting and removing, I cut stem all the way off, this is my preference. My flow ranges from light to heavy, or so I thought. I usually dump it as often as I would change a tampon, about every 6 hours (you can safely wear this cup for 12 hours). The amount of blood I see in the cup doesn't compare to my overly saturated tampons at all. My tampons would get so ""full' the string would be covered in blood after 6 hours. Makes me think tampon absorbency is highly exaggerated. I would occasionally wear pads or pantie liners in combo with tampons during my heaviest days, so that when the string became saturated there was something more to protect my underwear. I've had zero leakage with my cup. To be disgustingly honest, I can't stand the smell of my period. But the entire time I have used this cup, I have had zero nasty period smell. My entire attitude about having periods has changed, I'm actually bummed my period is over and I have to wait another 3 weeks to use my cup. I will never buy tampons or pads again.  So *TLDR* make the change, stop spending money month after month on pads, tampons, pantie liners. This thing will pay for itself and lasts for years."
5,"5 star Purées fruits and vegetables very well, I use it to make baby food. Does a great job regardless of the amount being prepared. The plastic cup that is included with the purchase is very helpful in that it works well with the size of the blender, and is very much appreciated."

2,"Poor sound quality, returned I bought these as inexpensive Bluetooth gym headphones.  For reference, my other headphones are Fostex TH-X00's, Beyerdynamic DT 770's, the AKG earbuds that came with my Samsung phone, and a cheap $10 set of earbuds I use for my motorcycle.  I know you need to have earbuds sealed well in your ear to get good sound.  Also, my expectations were not crazy high either -- I understand they're inexpensive.  I simply couldn't stand how these sounded, so I returned them.  Bass is emphasized in the UPPER-lows, and just doesn't reach down well at all.  That emphasized frequency range also seems to drown out the adjacent mid frequencies, so there's a perceived dip there, and then its like the upper mids were boosted to compensate for the drowned out lower mids.  In some songs (mostly rock) these flaws could be ignored, but for the majority of songs it was just too obvious.  The $10 random-Chinese-brand earbuds I have sound better than these.  On the plus side the build quality is excellent.  They're light weight but feel sturdy.  Battery also life seemed quite good.  It sucks about the sound quality because I really wanted to like them.  Instead I'm spending money to ship them back to Amazon.  I guess its time to spin the roulette again to see if another model will be adequate."

I hoped to wear these on a spa day and some light shopping but I don’t think I’ll wear them outside of my house. They might make nice pajamas though as they are so lightweight and they are pretty."
1,"Can’t read the time Awful watch.  I returned it without even putting it on.  You can’t read the analog or digital time because the hands blend int the face and the illumination is a joke.  Just don’t buy it."
4,"Really impressed, quality is that of a more expensive backpack *** 3-MONTH EDIT: one of the straps completely tore off at the top after using this backpack for only 3 months. Really disappointed I didn't keep the warranty papers. It happened during finals and was super hard carrying everything I needed. Will post pictures later ****  My previous 5-star review: Really great quality. Love the vintage-y hipster style. Got it for college. My friends are shocked when I tell them this is only a $40 backpack. Leather is nice, straps are comfortable, pockets are convenient, laptop compartment has a normal amount of padding, looks and feels great. The side pockets are big enough for my camelback water bottle (that was important for me). My only concern is the leather getting damaged in the rain. Hasn't happened yet, but I'm really nervous about it getting wet and ruining the top flap."
4,"Four Stars Exactly what I expected."
4,"NIce leggings. Just Not for Me. I am madly searching for a warm pair of fleece lined leggings. I've already ordered a few and none are quite right. Based on reviews and other purchases they're not good,at lease for me. I ordered a medium. Typically fleece lined leggings don't have much give or stretch because of the lining. These are the same. But I just can't get the right size. I'm 5'4 130 and normally wear a small, but in these I ordered a medium. Too big and for me too shiny. I want matte. The're heavy and warm. I put them on in my apartment and I was roasting.LOL They're kinda high waist but the waistband is thin, not at all compression. They're not at all bad for the price, but they just didn't work out for me. Sigh."

5,"STILL Very happy with these earrings !!! These earrings are SO PRETTY!!  They met and even exceeded my expectations.  Originally, I meant them for a gift to my granddaughter and nieces as they are young teens and I thought the smaller size was more appropriate for them.  Well, I’m back to purchase more so that I can have a pair for myself.  After wearing these little pretties only a couple of times the finish on one of them was tarnished looking, kind of a grayish tone.  Yes, I was disappointed, so I contacted the seller and they were replaced immediately.  Because I adore these (and I have a wealth of other earrings, both costume and “real” ) my only thought was how to correct this flaw. ( I would like to remind those that bitterly complain about everything that these are NOT 14k, only PLATED, and not presented as such, so put on your big girl panties and get over yourself)!!  I apologize if I sound harsh, and will likely ruffle someone’s feathers, but I’m 75 years old and don’t have much patience for whiners.  My solution is to apply some clear nail polish on both sides, and let dry thoroughly before wearing them. It may not be the most sophisticated treatment, and I’m certainly open to other suggestions. NO, I haven’t been paid to defend this item, I just happen to really like them and have purchased another couple pair for gifts."
5,"Nice Accessory. Stylish, trendy, low profile. Looks great with formal attire or casual attire. Amazon had the best price too."
5,"Our favorite as Medela fans! We chose Medela based on quality and family/friend references. The Medela nipples work very well with the several types of Medela bottles that we have with breastmilk. We have not had any leaks or related issues. Sometimes the nipple will invert if our baby is really sucking quite hard; pull it from their mouth and it adjusts itself. Our baby is now 6 weeks and the flow has worked just fine for her. She has gone from breast to bottle nipple (and back &amp; forth) without issue. And the nipples hold up in boiling water, top rack dish washing device and general hand washing. We will definitely purchase more if we need them!"
5,"Very nice Very nice back pack. Its slim and sleek. Its coloring is beautiful aswell as the material. The back pack holds alot, but at the same time is not large and bulky looking. I am a small girl and I travel alot. I honestly just wanted a back pack that can hold alot, but still look cute wearing. Its perfect. It has many compartments. I am a little bit ocd and I really like to seperate things so that's a plus for me. I also like how it sits above my butt if you put the strings on its tightest. If its below the butt I kind of feel like a turtle. Anyway very nice."
5,"Authentic Apple product- good price. Some of the reviews on here caused me doubts at first if these were the real deal (since it’s a gamble with Amazon sometimes to avoid getting knock offs). But I ordered them despite those reviews. They arrived and appear to be the real deal. I bought two sets of these and compared them to the originals that I had gotten with my iPhone. You can’t tell them apart. They look, sound and operate in every way - these are authentic Apple Ear Pods with the Lightning Connector. All packaging appears to be legit too. A good deal for the price. (Apple Ear Pods were never designed for complete noise cancellation- hence the 3 stars for those that are looking for that feature in this item)."
5,"Good buy Fits perfectly and I love it! I am 5'3 and 100 lbs so a small fits perfect for me."
5,"Definitely worth it! I’ve been wanting a pair of wireless earbuds for a while and I was excited to receive these! For the price, it’s definitely worth it plus more. The sound quality is amazing and completely blocks out outside sounds. I highly recommend them!"
5,"Can't live without this stuff! Back ground on me- I am 45 &amp; within the last 2, probably even 3 years. I noticed mentally &amp; emotionally more than anything (I wasn't me), I was cranky, edgy, emotional, couldn't remember things that happened within 5 mins, I felt crazy. I told myself it was stress. Then in the last year, my period started ghosting, then for a few months it seemed I was only spotting, next was I got a UTI. I felt a mess, my body felt like it had been high jacked. I went to my gyno who was all of 25 years old maybe. She gave me medz for UTI &amp; told me to continue working out, eat healthy, reduce my stress. She told me it might be early menopause. I did what she told me &amp; kept trying that along with vitamins that I would google to ease symptoms. Nothing helped. I couldn't have sex because I felt like every time my boyfriend touched me, I never knew if I would begin to spot or worse start my period. Started having cronic UTI's. So I went back to gyno but a new one this time, she was concerned for my symptoms- ran a bunch of tests &amp; nothing. All the while, I am trying to manage my body that feels out of control.  I then found this stuff- after a lot of googling, reading &amp; researching. I thought maybe this is all early menopause. Even though all of my friends thought I was crazy for even saying it. I ordered it on a whim of this would be my last try before I set out for a new Dr'. I had no clue when my period was due anymore. So I didn't start the cream till the next full moon (I had read to do that).  The first day HUGE change!!!! By day 2 &amp; 3- people were starting to ask me what I was doing different &amp; looking at me like my body had been taken over by a happy person. Finally!!!! I was back, I could tell it &amp; suddenly could see how bad I had felt &amp; didn't even realize it because it had been going on for so long! My daughter noticed &amp; that is what hit me the hardest. Because I really hadn't realized, how much I had changed &amp; how long she'd been living with me but without me. I will not go without this stuff now. I am still playing with how much I need &amp; how often. I also did gain a few pounds while trying to figure this balance thing out. But I will SO take that weight at the price of having my sanity &amp; body back."
5,"Best Purchase I've Made In Years. This is an awesome product!  I bought the rolling backpack because I have a bad back and always have a lot of stuff in my backpack...it does not disappoint.  There is plenty of room for everything...admin supplies in the front pocket and notebook and folders in middle pocket.  The back pocket (more like a section) has a laptop sleeve that easily fits a 17"" laptop and then room behind the sleeve for lunch box, compact umbrella, travel coffee mug and more.  Plus, my 32 oz. cold-water mug fits in a pouch on the outside.  I've drug this backpack back and forth across six blocks of cobblestone sidewalk several times to visit my office's HQ and it's held up just fine. My only complaint is that I didn't figure this out a year ago."
5,"recommend recommend to infant，soft and good quality."
5,"Does the job! I like these for the price, and I think the material feels softer after washing. They do a good job keeping you dry in cool weather when you sweat which is the most important thing! I think they run a tad big, I ordered a small and it fits me loosely when I would have preferred them more snug."
2,"I’m concerned about my health using this I wish it didn’t have prop 65 and all those chemicals, otherwise it’s a great programmed blender. To just blend it’s a little tricky and difficult. I returned this one and got a vitamix A3500 instead."

Also, it got me through the decorations for my sons second birthday so I can’t fault it that much lol. It got the job done. I just wish the glue was a lot stronger and able to hold certain types of material together."
4,"works just fine so far works just fine so far. It's a little under powered and the turn table and rotating mechanism seem a bit weak."
5,"Very Happy I got several of these shorts in different colors for my teenage daughter.  She wears them under skirts, dresses, and gym shorts.  They are essential to her, and she's very happy with them."
5,"‘ Good item"
5,"love them!! These are the best leggings ever!!! I am 5’4” 140lbs and got the tween size. They are perfect length with no bunching at the ankles. They are not see thru at all! I have the band folded over, so they go higher then shown in the picture."
5,"Shaped like a Tumi and basically as good as one Got this for my boyfriend. He gets tons of compliments and can stuff it to within an inch of its life. He takes it on daily errands as well as took it on a light packed weekend trip. Great airplane backpack as well."
5,"Ink cartridges Great product but expensive!"
5,"Highly recommended Love this product!!!! I was a little worried when I ordered it cause the price is lower than what I would expect for everything included in the package, and now I’ve been using it more than a week I would say it’s perfect—easy to use easy to clean. Highly recommended."
5,"Impressive - Some NC Tips - Hot Swappable Bluetooth for multi-device use ! Overall: I give these a 9 out of 10.  I. Noice Cancelling (NC):    The NC of these earbuds are nothing short   of Absolutely Amazing, bar none!    To anyone who says differently, they probably   have not taken the time to form a proper   seal.    Here’s a good way to test for a proper seal:    1. Wear the earbuds, NC set to ON, in a noisy   environment.    (I used a stretch of highway in a car).    2. See if lightly pushing inward on one (or both)   earbuds causes the outside sound to become   more quiet.    If it gets quieter, you do not have a good fit.   Try to form a better seal: push inward, twist,   pull outward a tad, whatever ...    If you still can not get a proper seal,   change to another tip size.    You may even find you need different sizes for   each ear. I wear the default size in left,   and one size up in the right.    I think many owners will probably not be enjoying   the full NC that these units are capable of.    I want to confirm that there is a vast difference   in each of the three levels:    Ambient Sound: outside sound is passed   through with a very slight amplification.    Ambient Sound Off: the earplug effect solely   from eartips.    Noise Cancelling: ambient sound is cancelled   to various degrees based on the app setting   with an optional checkbox dedicated to   pass/not pass the vocal range of frequencies.   When fully engaged, all car road noise was   completely eliminated; and you experience   driving in silence while feeling all the   bumps in the road. Wow !!!  II. Comfort    In testing the battery usage, I wore the earbuds   all day at work with NC on. Although, I do not   believe these earbuds are AS-COMFORTABLE-AS my   Jabra Elite 65t's, they are still fairly   comfortable. I did not suffer from discomfort or   fatigue after wearing them a little over five hours.    UPDATE: I have not worn my Jabra's in over   a week now; I decided to use them. Now, I   feel it's just a different fit, and I   actually feel the Sony's are more comfortable   than the Jabra's.  III. Battery Usage: (not quite as good as they claim)    BLUF:  5.25 hrs.    This was with Noice Cancellign ON, DSEE HX   on, &amp; Bluetooth focus on Sound Quality vs   Connection This may be why my experiences are   below other reports where battey usage is   right on the mark.    The battery readings (on the iOS app anyway)   jump in steps: 100%, 70%, 50% and 20%. Both   left and right units drain in unison. You can   see one unit at 70% and the other change 70%   to 50%, but that apparent difference is only   shown for 2 mins, and the other unit will   drop from 70% to 50% to match.  I.e., they   ""bump down"" farily close to the same time,   but not exactly at same time.    I ran with NC on and loud AC unit at work for   3.75 hours before reaching 20% and hearing   the first voice prompt to recharge units.   Continuing, I achieved 5 1/4 hours of usage   before the units gave a second recharge   prompt, and then powered themselves off.  IV. Have Two Devices? Enjoy ""Hot Swappable""   Bluetooth Connection !!!    Hot Swappable BT Connection is a feature that   many have missed in reviews. If you plan to   connect with multiple devices, this should be   important to you.    Hot Swappable means you do not have to   disconnect from one device (yourself) in   order to switch to another device. The   earbuds will disconnect from the first device   automatically when you connect to a second   device.    It's fast and reliable! You'll get audio   confirmations too: ""Bluetooth disconnected,   bluetooth connected.""    (This feature works for any device that has   ever been connected before. If it's the first   time the device has connected, this feature   will not work.)  A Word on the Blue Blinking Light Thing ...  There were some very early on concerns that the blinking blue lights would be annoying at night in comments on you tube - it’s nothing to be concerned about - the lights don’t blink when you’re wearing them - they signal Bluetooth connection and allow you to know when they auto power off if you take them off, and don’t place them in the case.  There is an off/on setting to auto power off in 5 mins if they are not being worn, and not in the case.  Pros:    Outstanding sound signature !    All the detailed items listed above   -especially hot swap bluetooth.    The touch panels are reliable, ( not   my experience with Sennheisers).  Cons:    Phone quality is good if you’re in a quiet environment;   Otherwise, hit and miss - too unreliable at times.    No direct volume control from the units themselves  (wondering if future firmware will address this)    The Sony Connect app (ironically) has to re-connect   if you ever switch to another app, blank the screen,   or minimize it. The app should be named   the Re-Connect app.  UPDATE Sept 8, 2019.  ANC comparison with overEar ======================================  So I’ve heard how much better over-the-ear headphones are for active noise cancelling. Yesterday, I was passing by a Best Buy, and had these earbuds with me.  I wanted to do a head-to-head comparison of these, the WH 1000xm3’s and the Bose 700.  I didn’t play any music - just Noise Cancelling comparison. I stayed about 40 mins ... and heard a few different background environments - overhead speaker announcements, conversations of customers, and loud deep base entertainment demos ... I walked away with the following three thoughts:  (a) no headphones offer perfect noise cancelling.  They all do a fantastic job - but none are perfect.  (b) I was disappointed with the over-the-ear headphones not being MUCH MUCH better than these earbuds.  If the over-the-ear headphone were better, then it wasn’t by very much at all - it’s not a STARK difference, it’s barely perceivable if at all.  (Yeah, I know, I’m going to be accused of being paid by Sony to write this - but this was my experience. I was thinking that if over-the-ear phones were drastically better, I may walk out of the store purchasing the Bose 700 -as those are best for phone calls.)  (c) There is absolutely no way in the world that I  would buy either the Sony WH 1000xm3, or the Bose 700 over-the-ear headphones - not when these wf 1000xm3’s arepractically keeping up with NC-ing with very little difference, and they’re cheaper, and a lot more convenient.  I remain very happy with purchasing these units and my only complaint is phone call quality for the person on the other end.  =====  If you found this review helpful, chances are others would too.

5,"Really Nice Product This cream has a great consistency. Its not like the usual gel lubricants. I especially like that it is made with 4 natural &amp; organic  ingredients. Also its lasts a long time."
5,"It’s just right. A regular pack was getting too heavy for me. This is great!"
5,"Fast and well priced We make smoothies and frozen hot chocolates for a family of 8. This is perfect for us, it crushes ice to snow, fast. I've had it for two days, but I used my previous Vitamix for over 30 yrs (it was my dad's and he let me take it home)."
5,"Great Watch!  I love it! The watch looks great! Very unique and although it's bezel is busy, the hands are large sword hands that are very easy to see so telling time is easy. The blue Lume is excellent and just as good as superluminova.  The Eco Drive is nice (no battery change for probably 10+ Years). The band looks great. The slide rule is a fun feature, but not really handy (you can figure the same info with your smartphone much faster). Has a screw down crown &amp; 20atm WR. Face is nice &amp; large, but not too large (I have a 7"" wrist and it looks good/fits me). It's very comfortable and surprisingly light if you're used to medium heavy stainless steel watches, but I have come to like the wt. &amp; comfort very much. Crystal on mine is Hardlex (I have the Jspanese model); American model has a mineral crystal, but you're not getting a sapphire crystal at this price point. Bought my version on EBay for $208. The international warranty is only 1year compared to the US version (3-5yr), but I figured its a Citizen so 3-5 years shouldn't be an issue. I've had a great track record w/Citizen watches over the past 20 years. Also the Jspanese version has a nicer etched case back compared to the flat generic looking one on the American version (&amp; saved about $50-60) and the Lume aspect of the hour markers are smaller on mine (equivocal to US model IMHO)."
5,"Love it! I get more compliments on this watch than any other in my collection. It has become my daily watch now. Love it!"
5,"Cool watch High quality!!!"
2,"Too many pockets that aren't needed. Too bulky &amp; heavy It's heavier than needed because the laptop pocket is very thickly padded with its own zipper. Plus the water bottle problem cost us actually quite short. Large full water bottles are not going to seat deep enough in my opinion.  I was hoping for a bigger open space not two smaller sections.  I think this is more of a business backpack. I think a business traveler might love this. A personal traveler who may not need a laptop and a tablet - this may be overkill. The other smaller backpack holds a tablet or chrome book wonderfully along with a light sweater, a large water bottle, and lots of other items - wallet, phone, sunscreen, umbrella etc."
3,"Just eh Eh. Gold is a little too bright for my liking and looks a little cheap."
1,"Not a strong tasting coffee I and my wife thought this coffee was too very weak. We like stronger coffee. We gave this a go, because of the price."
1,"Do not buy these. Waste of money. I purchased these based on the positive reviews. There is no way this product could get a 5-star rating. The paper is obviously NOT 24 lb weight. Paper weight feels up to  30% thinner than the claimed 24lb. weight when I compared them to other comparable competitor’s envelopes that were also claiming to be 24lb weight. As other reviewers stated, the security feature is a joke. With a medium light, you can see through the envelope. The glue is a tiny, thin line of glue. The removable paper strip looks to be almost half the size of that shown on the packaging.  My biggest outrage is the paper weight. They claim 24lb.... maybe with the front and back measured together?! This product is meant to deceive. I was suspicious when I saw the picture of the box, as it appeared to be about half the size of a 100 count box of Staples brand envelopes that were a similar product. Now I know why! I suspect the glowing 5 Star reviews to be fake or at the best, reviews that were place years ago when ""maybe"" the product was manufactured better. In either case, DO NOT BUY THESE! I'll go back to Staples or some other office store to see what they have. The Staples brand I bought about five years ago were really nice, but they too have been cost-reduced and are no where near the quality they used to be, but they are still better than these."
4,"Love it! This is the cutest little backpack! My son is 2 and he takes to daycare. It's the perfect size for him but is probably too small for a school-aged kid. I added his name to the pocket on the front and it's adorable!"
4,"Four Stars It is just the right size fo my small kitchen."
5,"Very soft and perfect fit. I purchased this shirt in a few colors. I wanted a shirt that I can wear to work under my sweaters and ponchos. This shirt totally fits the bill. If I wear it with heels and dress pants it’s perfect, and in the same turn, if I wear it with jeans and sneakers or plain boots, it’s perfect also. Can be dressed up or down. It kind of a silky type material But it is so soft on the skin. I am usually a size XS or Small, I am 5’3” and 110-115 lbs (depending on the day of the week). Lol I ordered the small and the fit is great. Could probably gain 15 or 20 lbs and it would still fit. It’s stretchy and roomy but doesn’t look big."
5,"Very pretty Love, not flimsy and good material doesn’t bother  ears at all"
5,"Love this product I use this cold brew coffee maker daily. Set-up is easy and the flavor of the coffee is wonderful. Make sure to use a quality coarse ground coffee. I use 1 cup pf grounds to 4 cups of water. I pour 3 cups of water into the coffee maker. Add the grounds to the filter, submerge into the maker, then pour the remaining cup of water into the filter. This soaks the grounds first. Final step is to attach the lid, shake and set in the refrigerator. I usually brew for approx 24hrs. The only drawback is in the cleanup of the filter. Coffee grounds at the bottom are difficult to get out but not overly so. Just wish they would come up with a better way to clean out the filter. Other than that, I love it!"
5,"Value for money. Combining the price and the excellent quality- the shirt totally worth it. The shirt looks pretty good on the body, even if you're not ""fitted"", and the sleeves are pretty tight( in a good way) but not too tight. It's easy to notice that the quality of the shirt is on the next level."
5,"This is a really awesome backpack, it's bigger than I expected so it's ... This is a really awesome backpack, it's bigger than I expected so it's perfect for the school and I'm very happy :D"
5,"Worth it for me and my girlfriend Bought one in grey and one in black for both me and my girlfriend to do a long weekend flying from jersey to Florida. Held up to over packing them and the charger port worked just fine on both bags with iPhones and Bluetooth headphones. Fit perfectly in the free carry on bag thing for spirit air lines. For the price they were worth it for us."
5,"Very nice watch with great nightlight I bought this after my husband liked mine better than the black strapped version I gave him. He says I kept the better one for myself. Now we both have the gold large face Indiglo . They are sturdy,reliable,and nice enough to wear all the time. Very good price for such a nice watch. I have had mine for a year and a half and the original band is still in good shape after daily wear,inside and outside."
5,"So Versatile!! I love these pens! I was so excited to get them, I love the dual head and all the different sizes you can get out of these pens. I am a writer and I have a bullet journal and I use colored pens every single day. These are going to be my go-to now. (Please ignore the green smudge at the bottom.)"
5,"Great mixer Very powerful mixer. Easy to maneuver"
5,"Good stuff Drink it several times a day. Good medium blend for the price"
5,"Dry large and very pretty! Dry large and very pretty!"
5,"Surprise. Had to laugh when these arrived. I never ordered them. But I guess I did. And everyone can use #2 pencils.  Not upset. I’ll be more careful next time."
5,"Post-it Notes are cool I bought the Marseille 24 pads pack and I love them! They look exactly as pictured. They also do their job, they stick."
5,"Beautiful Time Piece The quality and appearance is simply beautiful. The color contrast with the rough brown leather, silver body, gold hands and gorgeous green face is so unique and eye catching. My new favorite, even over my antique Omega."
2,"Good fake? It’s a good looking watch, perfect for every day wear given the price. Unfortunately it doesn’t appear to be a tru Ivicta, likely fake given it’s knobs are not screw-in meaning the watch is not good for submersion into water, may not even be safe to wash your hands without getting it damaged. The accompanying booklet states its knobs are screw-in and it’s safe for diving up to 100 meters, but the item itself does not correspond with provided info"
3,"Why do they leak??? I have a love hate relationship with these bottles/nipples. We bought them for our baby and they would leak on and off like crazy no matter how tight you screwed it on. We thought maybe it was the nipples. It would stop for a while then randomly leak again. Fast forward to needing next size and surprise surprise.... they leak. Our baby really likes this nipple but the leaking is really frustrating. If they didn't leak I would 100% recommend."
3,"order 3x I wear a 2x and order a 3x to assure it fits and if i make one move a roll is popping out"
1,"Beautiful watch while it lasts -- but warranty covered replacement I've owned a number of Timex watches in the past beginning in 1964.  This one was attractive, large enough numbers to easily read, and the built-in light for seeing the time when it's completely dark.  As I was flying to Ireland and wanting to change the time from Eastern Standard to Ireland's time, The stem pulled out completely.  Now the built-in light no longer works and it's very tricky to find the exact spot to place the stem to change the time. I wish it had done this in the return window, but of course it didn't.  I invoked the warranty and decided to pay to get it fixed.  Although I had registered my watch when I bought it, I still had to download the Amazon invoice as proof of purchase.  At this point, you go on the timex.com website to print a label for shipping it to them.  A bit of confusion on whether I should include an $8 check (nothing is proofread these days for consistency).  A couple weeks later a new watch arrived.  At least I think it was a new watch -- it was shipped from the Philippines and I had sent it to Pennsylvania for warranty."
1,"The band did expand quickly as well but I was pretty apathetic to that After 2 weeks of use, I noticed that it did not properly keep time, because the center knob kept getting pulled out in regular use.  After 3.5 weeks of use, the center knob just completely broke out.  Am I going to go through the hassle of a warranty return? I got it on sale, so probably not since the cost of shipping + handling would be similar to the sale price.  The timer buttons are also somewhat difficult to press and there is no tactile feedback. There is no point in ""50 ms"" accuracy if you can't know when you pushed the button accuracy.  The band did expand quickly as well but I was pretty apathetic to that.  Overall one star."
4,"... watch for a week but so far I really like it. The only negative is the instruction book ... I have only had the watch for a week but so far I really like it.  The only negative is the instruction book which measures one inch by two inches and is an inch thick.  The print is so small it makes a legal document look like a newspaper headline.  I finally went online printed off a copy."
4,"For 110 piercings ya can't go wrong! Yeah... Not a bad deal that's for sure!! Some of the balls fall off kind of quickly, bit it's not like ya don't have another lol, super worth the money!"
4,"Decent first automatic watch, but mind the hype. As the title states, this is my first automatic watch but it isn't my first watch or even my first Seiko. I figured if I'm going to try out an automatic, I shouldn't spend much so I'm fine with the price I paid.  First Impression: My other Seiko watch is a solar chronograph, which is larger, thicker and heavier than the SNK809 so the first thing I noticed was the weight difference. I also noticed just how small the watch case is, which is acceptable. However, the fact that it is a smaller watch also makes the watch dials feel busier/more cluttered than I expected.  The Band: The nylon band, as many reviewers have mentioned, is not great. It fits well with the military aesthetic of the watch, but that's pretty much the only positive thing I can say. The band is scratchy, it gets snagged on certain types of cloth, and it's not easy to put on or take off. The last point might be the major function of the band: to securely keep the watch on your wrist. Verdict: buy another band and accept the fact that you're not paying for the stock one.  Usage: In terms of accuracy, I haven't had any real issues. You cannot get a cheap automatic expecting it to keep time to the second like a quartz watch. Mine is still on the correct minute marker after wearing it for three days, so I have nothing unacceptable to report. Since the watch is an automatic, you have to wear it regularly (every other day is my policy) to keep it running. The date and day of week are easy enough to adjust as long as you follow instructions.  Summary: It's a good introductory, automatic watch from a functional and value perspective. It's not the most stylish looking timepiece nor is it the most comfortable, in my opinion. If you are into the rugged, military aesthetic, this watch might just work for you. There are plenty of Seiko 5 variants, so if you don't truly like what you see, keep looking! Many of them have the same 7S26 movement (the mechanical guts) and work the same way, so you'll most likely find one that does suit your style. In conclusion, I would probably buy another Seiko 5, but maybe not this particular one."
5,"Good buy My son uses this daily for school and he loves the bag. Good material and well put together"
5,"Works and cleans up great.  Fast cooking Love my new induction cooktop"
5,"Great business travel backpack This backpack is very comfortable with all the padding. Liking all of the organizing and how much you can store in this. Seems to be very well built and no problems so far."
5,"Yeah, It’s an Invicta, but with a Seiko Movement! This is a great inexpensive, everyday watch.  Yeah, it’s an Invicta and there are lots of haters out there, but I have an open mind.  This is not one of the gawdy, oversized Invictas, it’s a great size.  Plus, Invictas have proven themselves as far as I’m concerned.  They have their place.  I have 3 of them and have NEVER had any issues with quartz or mechanical.  I’m into mechanicals/automatics and the price on this one was just too good to pass up.  I don’t care what anyone thinks, the watch looks great.  The best part is that it has a Seiko movement in it.  So if you’re a fan of Seiko movements, but can’t afford to buy too many Seikos, go with this watch.  It has a clear case-back and the rotor is colored to add a little detail.  I liked it much better on my wrist than in the pictures.  Since it’s a Seiko movement, it’s super quiet and very smooth when setting the date/time."
5,"My sister loved it! Nice gift"
5,"This is my favorite k-cup. I use these in my Keurig K250 This is my favorite k-cup. I use these in my Keurig K250. I've been getting these through Amazon for months and I've never had a problem with a single one of them. Yummy coffee too."
5,"Great find! We love this kettle!  The water boils FAST, with a cool blue light!  It sits on the heater, but the carafe is not connected to the heater.  Works AMAZINGLY!"
5,"Nice casual pants, will order more These pants are as comfortable as leggings but are more versatile, especially for an older woman who isn't comfortable wearing leggings out and about.  They fit as expected, I wear size 10 and ordered a medium.  The broad waistband fits nicely around my waist or upper hip.  (I have a trim waist since cutting out sugars and bad carbs.)  The leg is straight and comes to the right place at the ankle (I have long legs).  But I haven't washed them yet.  Will order another pair or two after I wash them to make sure about shrinkage."
5,"Perfect necklace for any woman! Necklace came exactly as described and my wife loves it. Thank you!"
5,"A warm beverage on a cold and snowy day! Bought four of these back in June 2016 after discovering the tried and true Brookstone versions had been discontinued. Researched most of the other brands out there and narrowed it down by wattage and past purchaser comments/opinions at different websites (to include Amazon). Keeps hot beverage warm, will not heat-up your beverage from a lukewarm or cold level. I note this only because of the many past purchaser comments that gave these and other brands low marks for not making their cold beverage piping hot! (?). These have kept our ceramic cups of coffee, tea and hot chocolate warm enough after pouring, all through our Wyoming winter this year (2016-17). Would buy again and would recommend to others."
5,"Great Backpack! I love this backpack! It’s perfect for school. I bike to school and this doesn’t cause me any back pain whatsoever. This is the authentic Fjallraven. My sister got one from their website and they are exactly the same. I recommend this backpack completely. I suggest you get a darker color though. The lighter ones tend to get dirty. Hope you enjoy your backpack as much as I do :)"
5,"Great roomy bag Bought this recently and just used it on a trip, great value, very sturdy and lots of room!!"
5,"Love these! I love these earrings, they are so lightweight and cute. The colors and designs are super fun for the holidays. I can mix and match them with all of my outfits."
2,"It's great but I wish it were bigger I initially wanted to order the purple one but when I went to order it was out of stock. That was fine so I ordered the black one instead. But whoever is in charge of packing and shipping sent me a grey one instead! No big deal I'm not too picky it's just a back pack. I also wish it was just a little bit bigger, I have an over 1000 page textbook I need to carry everyday for classes and nothing else really fits in there besides a binder or two (1"" ones at that). Overall good product. EDIT I've been using this backpack for about a month and a half now and the buttons for the flap are about to fall off. Still a useful backpack but it's becoming more apparent that it is cheaply made."
3,"It’s super cute but won’t last long Very cute bracelet but wore it once and it broke. I ended up making my own bracelet out of the pieces  Also I do have small wrists but it was pretty loose on me so I had to tighten it  I do love the design and leather part"
